You refuse to hunt a certain class of prey. You might refuse to feed on drug dealers, policemen, accountants, or rich people - if you accidentally feed upon such an individual, you automatically frenzy and must make a ^Conscience/Conviction^ roll to prevent Humanity or Path loss (difficulty 7). Witnessing other Kindred feeding on the object of your exclusion might also provoke a frenzy, at the Storytellerâ€™s discretion. Ventrue, owing to the limitations already imposed on their feeding by their Clan weakness, may not take this Flaw.
