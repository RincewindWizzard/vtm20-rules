There is no ecstasy in your Embrace - only terror and pain. Mortals upon whom you feed struggle and shriek while you attempt to feed, requiring you to grapple with them for as long as you wish to take their blood. For vampires with high Humanity, this experience may require a ^Humanity^ roll, at the discretion of the Storyteller. Giovanni cannot take this Flaw.
