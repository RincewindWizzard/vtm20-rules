You have some kind of deformity - a mis-shapen limb, hunchback, or club foot, for example - which affects your physical abilities and interactions with others. A hunchback, for instance, would lower a characterâ€™s Dexterity by two dots and increase the difficulty of die rolls relating to social skills by one. It is the responsibility of the Storyteller to determine the specific effects of the deformity chosen.
