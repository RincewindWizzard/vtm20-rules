You’re the latest in the city to be Embraced or have yet to prove yourself to your Sect, and everyone knows it. That automatically puts you at the bottom of the social totem pole. Other neonates take every opportunity to demonstrate your inferiority, or rival packs constantly test your worthiness to the Sabbat. Even if someone else is added to the ranks of the unliving, you’re still regarded as something as a bit of a geek by your peers - a distinction that can have dangerous consequences if bullets start fying. All Social-related rolls are at +1 difficulty when you are dealing with other neonates (Ancillae and elders lump you in with all the other neonates under their general disdain).
