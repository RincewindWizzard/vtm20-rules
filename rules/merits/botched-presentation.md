When your sire presented you to the Prince of the city, you fubbed it. Now youâ€™re convinced His Majesty hates you (whether he does or not). You need to succeed on a ^Willpower^ roll (difficulty 7) just to stand in front of the Prince or one of his duly authorized representatives without running, blubbering, or otherwise making a fool of yourself. This Flaw can only be taken by Camarilla vampires.
