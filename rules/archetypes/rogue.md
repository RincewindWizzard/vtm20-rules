Name: "Rogue"
---

Only one thing matters to the Rogue: herself. To each his own, and if others cannot protect their claims, they have no right to them. The Rogue is not necessarily a thug or bully, however. She simply refuses to succumb to the whims of others. Rogues almost universally possess a sense of self-sufficiency. They have their own best interests in mind at all times. Prostitutes, capitalists and criminals all embody the Rogue Archetype. Kindred Rogues include diablerists, Autarkis, and a Primogen who puts his Clan’s opportunities before the supremacy of the Kindred as a whole.

At the Storyteller’s discretion, accumulating gain without exposing your own weaknesses may let you regain two points of Willpower. As well, you may regain a point of Willpower when your efforts benefit the group to which you belong when that benefit comes at the expense of another group.
