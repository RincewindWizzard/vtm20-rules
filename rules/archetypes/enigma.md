Name: "Enigma"

Your actions are bizarre, puzzling, and inexplicable to everyone except yourself. Your strangeness may be a residual effect from your Embrace, or the most effective way for you to carry out your work. To the rest of the world, however, your erratic actions suggest that youâ€™re eccentric if not completely crazy. Conspiracy theorists, deep-cover agents, and Jyhad fanatics all live up to the Enigma Archetype
 - Regain a point of Willpower whenever someone is completely perplexed or baffed by one of your actions that later turns out to be a fruitful endeavor.
