Name: "Idealist"
---

The Idealist believes - truly, madly, deeply - in some higher goal or morality. The object of his idealism may be something as pragmatic as the Camarillaâ€™s eventual triumph or as amorphous as the ultimate good, but the belief is there. Idealists are frequently either very new to the Blood or very old, and many seek Golconda as the final expression of their idealism. In the meantime, an Idealist tries to reconcile his beliefs with the demands of vampiric existence, often acting contrary to his self-interest in doing so.
