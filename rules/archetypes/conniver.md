Name: "Conniver"
---

Why work for something when you can trick somebody else into getting it for you? The Conniver always tries to find the easy way, the fast track to success and wealth. Some people call him a thief, a swindler, or less pleasant terms, but he knows that everybody in the world would do unto him if they could. He just does it first, and better. Criminals, con artists, salespeople, urchins, and entrepreneurs might be Connivers. Some would argue that all Kindred are Connivers in some sense, but those that have the Conniver archetype maybe abusive to their childer and ghouls, or they may be more persuasive in gaining support for their machinations.
 - Regain a point of Willpower whenever you trick someone into doing something for you, or when you convince someone to help you against their own best interests.
