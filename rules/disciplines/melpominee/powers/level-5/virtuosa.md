Most of the low-level Melpominee powers can only be used on one target at a time. When the Daughter reaches this level of mastery in her Discipline, she can “entertain” a wider audience. Each member of the audience hears the same message.
_System_: The Daughter may use Phantom Speaker or Siren’s Beckoning on a number of targets equal to her ^Stamina + Performance^. The player must spend one blood point for every five targets beyond the first.
