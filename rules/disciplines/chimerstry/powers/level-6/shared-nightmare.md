Even though Horrid Reality is visible to all onlookers, it can only inflict “damage” on one victim. With Shared Nightmare, a vampire can inflict her tormented visions on a crowd.
_System_: To use this power, the player must spend two Willpower points, plus one blood point per target. The player rolls ^Manipulation + Subterfuge^ once, but compares the results against each target individually. The difficulty is still each victim’s Perception + Self-Control/Instinct.
