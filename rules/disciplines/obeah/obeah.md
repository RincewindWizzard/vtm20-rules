The bloodline known in modern nights simply as the Salubri is actually descendant of one half of the ancient Clan. In bygone nights, one might have spoken of “healer” and “warrior” Salubri. In the modern nights, the last vestiges of the warrior Salubri are the <i>antitribu</i> of the Clan, and practice their Discipline of Valeren (see p. 474). The rest of the bloodline know the Discipline of Obeah. This Discipline allows the Salubri to judge and even improve a subject’s health. As the vampire grows more powerful, Obeah lets her heal a target’s soul directly. It is this power that forms the basis of the “soulsucker“ charge that dogs the bloodline these nights.

This Discipline gives its practitioners a third eye in the center of the vampire’s forehead when the Kindred masters the second level of Obeah.
