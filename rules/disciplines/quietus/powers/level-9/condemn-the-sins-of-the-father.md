name: Condemn the Sins of the Father

Although the Second City’s judges recognized that heritage does not equal guilt, they also encountered many situations in which a vampire’s entire brood had committed the same crime. In such cases, the judges often decreed the same punishment for all transgressors. This technique, which modern viziers believe to have originated at that time, allows its wielder to administer such judgments. Through Condemn the Sins of the Father, a Cainite can apply lesser Quietus powers to an entire lineage.
_System_: After successfully using any lesser Quietus power on another vampire, the player spends a permanent Willpower point and 10 blood points and rolls ^Stamina + Occult^. The difficulty of this roll is equal to four plus the number of Generations of the original target’s descendants that the player wants to affect, up to a maximum difficulty of 10. If the roll succeeds, every descendant of the original target within the specified range of Generations suffers the same effects that the original target experienced, resisting with his own relevant Traits. The player may exempt a number of potential subjects from this effect equal to twice the character’s Wits, but the character must know their faces or have tasted their vitae.
