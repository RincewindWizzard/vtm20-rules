name: Bring Forth the Dawn

This power does not actually cause the sun to rise, but rather triggers the daysleep in Kindred. The Child simply gestures, and the target’s Beast responds as though the sun had just risen outside. The Child can then beat a hasty retreat - or stake and behead the vampire now lying helpless before him.
_System_: The player spends a blood point for each vampire to be affected and rolls ^Manipulation + Occult^ in a contested roll against each target’s Humanity or Path (both rolls at difficulty 7). If the target wins, the power fails. If the Child wins, however, all affected vampires fall asleep for a number of hours equal to the Child’s net successes. Followers of Set and other blood-lines that share their weakness suffer a -2 to their dice pool for this roll. Any Disciplines or Thaumaturgy rituals which protect the Kindred during their sleep also work in defending against this level of Bardo.
