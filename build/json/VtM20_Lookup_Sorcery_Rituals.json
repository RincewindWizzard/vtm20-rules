The chanting climaxes when the necromancer removes one of her own eyes and replaces it with the one from the corpse (fresher is better). Kindred healing takes over at that point, sealing the eye within the socket.<br>If the ritual succeeds, the Necromancer permanently gains the Shroudsight ability (see p. 163).

Oddly enough, this ritual almost never takes in any tool that the caster finds himself needing during the assistant\u2019s lifespan, nor does it take the physical components of any other ritual nor any living thing. The servant has no personality to speak of at first, but gradually adopts the mannerisms and thought processes that the thaumaturge desires in an ideal servant. Sanguine Assistants are temporary creations, but some vampires become fond of their tiny accomplices and create the same one whenever the need arises.<br><b>System<\/b>: The player spends five blood points and rolls. The servant created by the ritual stands a foot (30 cm) high and appears as a roughly humanoid shape composed of whatever the ritual sucked in for its own use. It lasts for one night per success rolled. At the end of the last night, the assistant crawls into the bowl used for its creation and falls apart. The assistant can be reanimated through another application of this ritual; if the caster so desires, it re-forms from the same materials with the same memories and personality.<br>A Sanguine Assistant has Strength and Stamina of 1, and Dexterity and Mental Attributes equal to those of the caster. It begins with no Social Attributes to speak of, but gains one dot per night in Charisma and Manipulation until its ratings are equal to those of the caster. It has all of the caster\u2019s Abilities at one dot lower than his own. A Sanguine Assistant is a naturally timid creature and flees if attacked, though it will try to defend its master\u2019s life at the cost of its own. It has no Disciplines of its own, but has a full understanding of all of its master\u2019s Thaumaturgical knowledge and can instruct others if so commanded. A Sanguine Assistant is impervious to any mind-controlling Disciplines or magic, so completely is it bound to its creator\u2019s will."}, {"ID":"62","Name":"Shaft of Belated Quiescence","Level":"3","IsAssam":"0","IsKoldu":"0","IsNecro":"0","IsThaum":"1","Descr":"This ritual turns an ordinary stake of rowan wood into a particularly vicious weapon. When the stake penetrates a vampire\u2019s body, the tip breaks off and begins working its way through the victim\u2019s flesh to his heart. The trip may take several minutes or several nights, depending on where the stake struck. The stake eludes attempts to dig it out, burrowing farther into the victim\u2019s body to escape surgery. The only Kindred who are immune to this internal attack are those who have had their hearts removed by Serpentis.<br><b>System<\/b>: The ritual takes five hours to enact, minus 30 minutes per success. The stake must be carved of rowan wood, coated with three blood points of the caster\u2019s blood, and blackened in an oak-wood fire. When the ritual is complete, the stake is enchanted to act as described above.<br>An attack with a Shaft of Belated Quiescence is performed as with a normal stake: a ^Dexterity + Melee^ roll (difficulty 6, modified as per the normal combat rules; the attack does not need to specifically target the heart) with a lethal damage rating of Strength + 1. If at least one health level of damage is inflicted after the target rolls to soak, the tip of the stake breaks off and begins burrowing. If not, the stake may be used to make subsequent attacks until it strikes deep enough to activate.<br>Once the tip of the stake is in the victim\u2019s body, the Storyteller begins an extended roll of the caster\u2019s Thaumaturgy rating (difficulty 9), rolling once per hour of game time. Successes on this roll are added to the successes scored in the initial attack. This represents the tip\u2019s progress toward the victim\u2019s heart. A botch indicates that the tip has struck a bone and all accumulated successes are lost (including those from the initial attack roll). Removing the part of the body where the tip impacted (such as a Tzimisce turning into blood or a vampire cutting off their arm) may stop the tip\u2019s progress, depending on the number of successes acquired and the Storyteller\u2019s discretion. When the shaft accumulates a total of 15 successes, it reaches the victim\u2019s heart. This paralyzes Kindred and is instantly fatal to mortals and ghouls.<br>Attempts to surgically remove the tip of the shaft can be made with an extended Dexterity + Medicine roll made once per hour (difficulty 7 for Kindred and 8 for mortals). The surgeon must accumulate a number of successes equal to those currently held by the shaft in order to remove the tip. Once surgery begins, however, the shaft begins actively evading the surgeon\u2019s probes, and its rolls are made once every 30 minutes for the duration of the surgery attempt. Each individual surgery roll that scores less than three successes inflicts an additional unsoakable level of lethal damage on the patient.<br>Shaft of Belated Quiescence may be performed on other wooden impaling weapons, such as spears, arrows, practice swords, and pool cues, provided that they are made of rowan wood.

(The two rituals, however, are mutually exclusive.) A Splinter Servant consists of a stake carved from a tree which has nourished itself on the dead. The stake must be bound in wax-sealed nightshade twine. When the binding is torn off, the Splinter Servant leaps to life, animating itself and attacking whomever the wielder commands - or the wielder, if she is too slow in assigning a target. The servant splits itself into a roughly humanoid form and begins singlemindedly trying to impale the target\u2019s heart. Its exertions tear it apart within a few minutes, but if it pierces its victim\u2019s heart before it destroys itself, it is remarkably difficult to remove, as pieces tend to remain behind if the main portion is yanked out.<br><b>System<\/b>: The ritual requires 12 hours to cast, minus one per success, and the servant must be created as described above. When the binding is torn off, the character who holds it must point the servant at its target and verbally command it to attack during the same turn. If this command is not given, the servant attacks the closest living or unliving being, usually the unfortunate individual who currently carries it.<br>A Splinter Servant always aims for the heart. It has an attack dice pool of the caster\u2019s ^Wits + Occult^, a damage dice pool of the caster\u2019s Thaumaturgy rating, and a maximum movement rate of 30 yards or meters per turn. Note that these values are those of the caster who created the servant, not the individual who activates it. A Splinter Servant cannot fly, but can leap its full movement rating every turn. Every action it takes is to attack or move toward its target; it cannot dodge or split its dice pool to perform multiple attacks.<br>The servant makes normal stake attacks that aim for the heart (difficulty 9), and its success is judged as per the rules for a normal staking (see p. 280). A Splinter Servant has three health levels, and attacks directed against it are made at +3 difficulty due to its small size and erratic movement patterns.<br>A Splinter Servant has an effective life of five combat turns per success rolled in its creation.
