                    "#  Level 1\n<b>A Taste for Blood</b><br>This power was developed as a means of testing a foe\u2019s might - an extremely important ability in the tumultuous early nights of Clan Tremere. By merely touching the blood of his subject, the caster may determine how much vitae remains in the subject and, if the subject is a vampire, how recently he has fed, his approximate Generation and, with three or more successes, whether he has ever committed diablerie.<br><b>System</b>: The number of successes achieved on the roll determines how much information the thaumaturge gleans and how accurate it is.\n\n",
                    "# Level 2\n<b>Blood Rage</b><br>This power allows a vampire to force another Kindred to expend blood against his will. The caster must touch her subject for this power to work, though only the lightest contact is necessary. A vampire affected by this power might feel a physical rush as the thaumaturge heightens his Physical Attributes, might find himself suddenly looking more human, or may even find himself on the brink of frenzy as his stores of vitae are mystically depleted.<br><b>System</b>: Each success forces the subject to spend one blood point immediately in the way the caster desires (which must go towards some logical expenditure the target vampire could make, such as increasing Physical Attributes or powering Disciplines). Note that blood points forcibly spent in this manner may exceed the normal \u201cper turn\u201d maximum indicated by the victim\u2019s Generation. Each success gained also increases the subject\u2019s difficulty to resist frenzy by one. The thaumaturge may not use Blood Rage on herself to circumvent generational limits.\n\n",
                    "# Level 3\n<b>Blood of Potency</b><br>The thaumaturge gains such control over his own blood that he may effectively \u201cconcentrate\u201d it, making it more powerful for a short time. In effect, he may temporarily lower his own Generation with this power. This power may be used only once per night.<br><b>System</b>: One success on the Willpower roll allows the character to lower his Generation by one step for one hour. Each additional success grants the Kindred either one step down in Generation or one hour of effect. Successes earned must be spent both to decrease the vampire\u2019s Generation and to maintain the change (this power cannot be activated again until the original application wears off). If the vampire is diablerized while this power is in effect, it wears off immediately and the diablerist gains power appropriate to the caster\u2019s actual Generation. Furthermore, any mortals Embraced by the thaumaturge are born to the Generation appropriate to their sire\u2019s original Generation (e.g., a Tenth-Generation Tremere who has reduced his effective Generation to Eighth still produces Eleventh-Generation childer).<br>Once the effect wears off, any blood over the character\u2019s blood pool maximum dilutes, leaving the character at his regular blood pool maximum. Thus, if a Twelfth-Generation Tremere (maximum blood pool of 11) decreased his Generation to Ninth (maximum blood pool 14), ingested 14 blood points, and had this much vitae in his system when the power wore off, his blood pool would immediately drop to 11.\n\n",
                    "# Level 4\n<b>Theft of Vitae</b><br>A thaumaturge using this power siphons vitae from her subject. She need never come in contact with the subject - blood literally streams out in a physical torrent from the subject to the Kindred (though it is often mystically absorbed and need not enter through the mouth).<br><b>System</b>: The number of successes determines how many blood points the caster transfers from the subject. The subject must be visible to the thaumaturge and within 50 feet (15 meters). Using this power prevents the caster from being blood-bound, but otherwise counts as if the vampire ingested the blood herself. This power is spectacularly obvious, and Camarilla princes justifiably consider its public use a breach of the Masquerade.\n\n",
                    "# Level 5\n<b>Cauldron of Blood</b><br>A thaumaturge using this power boils her subject\u2019s blood in his veins like water on a stove. The Kindred must touch her subject, and it is this contact that simmers the subject\u2019s blood. This power is always fatal to mortals, and causes great damage to even the mightiest vampires.<br><b>System</b>: The number of successes gained determines how many blood points are brought to boil. The subject suffers one health level of aggravated damage for each point boiled (individuals with Fortitude may soak this damage using only their Fortitude dice). A single success kills any mortal, though some ghouls with access to Fortitude are said to have survived after soaking all of the aggravated damage."

The target must be inanimate, though dead organic matter can be affected.<br><b>System</b>: If the roll is successful, the inanimate object touched by the thaumaturge ages 10 years for every minute the Kindred touches it. If the vampire breaks physical contact and wishes to age the object again, another blood point must be spent and another roll must be made. This power does not affect vampires.\n\n",

This power may also be used to swell or contract wood, in addition to bending it into unwholesome shapes. Unlike other powers of this path, Gnarl Wood requires merely a glance rather than physical contact.<br><b>System</b>: Fifty pounds or twenty-five kilograms of visible wood may be gnarled for each blood point spent on this power (the thaumaturge may expend as much blood as she likes on this power, up to her per-turn generational maximum). It is also possible to warp multiple visible objects - like all the stakes a team of vampire-hunters wields.\n\n",
                    "# Level 3\n<b>Acidic Touch</b><br>The vampire secretes a bilious, acidic fluid from any portion of his body. The viscous acid corrodes metal, destroys wood, and causes horrendous chemical burns to living tissue.<br><b>System</b>: The player spends one blood point to create the acid - the blood literally transmutes into the volatile secretion. One blood point creates enough acid to burn through a quarter-inch or half a centimeter of steel plate or three inches (seven centimeters) of wood. The damage from an acid-augmented hand-to-hand attack is aggravated and costs one blood point per turn to use. A thaumaturge is immune to her own acidic touch.\n\n",
                    "# Level 4\n<b>Atrophy</b><br>This power withers a victim\u2019s limb, leaving only a desiccated, almost mummified husk of bone and skin. The effects are instantaneous; in mortals, they are also irreversible.<br><b>System</b>: The victim may resist the effects of Atrophy by scoring three or more successes on a Stamina + Athletics roll (difficulty 8). Failure means the limb is permanently and completely crippled. Partial resistance is possible: One success indicates that the difficulty of any roll involving the use of the arm increases by two, though these effects are still permanent with regard to mortals. Two successes signify that difficulties increase by one. Vampires afflicted by this power may spend five blood points to rejuvenate atrophied limbs. Mortals are permanently crippled. This power affects only limbs or parts of limbs (arms, legs, hands); it does not work on victims\u2019 heads, torsos, etc.\n\n",
                    "# Level 5\n<b>Turn to Dust</b><br>This fearsome power accelerates decrepitude in its victims. Mortals literally age at the mere touch of a skilled thaumaturge, gaining decades in moments.<br><b>System</b>: Each success on the roll ages the victim by 10 years. A potential victim may resist with a Stamina + Courage roll (difficulty 8), but must accumulate more successes than the caster\u2019s activation roll - it\u2019s an all-or-nothing affair. If the victim succeeds, he does not age at all. If he does not acquire more successes than the thaumaturge, he ages the full amount. Obviously, this power, while it affects vampires, has no detrimental effect on them (they\u2019re immortal). At most, a Kindred victim grows paler and withers slightly (-1 to Appearance) for one night."

See \u201cFire\u201d (p. 297) for more information on how vampires suffer from flame.<br>Fire conjured by The Lure of Flames must be released for it to have any effect.

This Thaumaturgical path enables powerful conjurations limited only by the mind of the practitioner.<br>Objects summoned via this path bear two distinct characteristics. They are uniformly \u201cgeneric\u201d in that each object summoned, if summoned again, would look exactly as it did at first. For example, a knife would be precisely the same knife if created twice; the two would be indistinguishable. Even a specific knife - the one a character\u2019s father used to threaten her - would appear identical every time it was conjured. A rat would have repeated \u201ctiled\u201d patterns over its fur, and a garbage can would have a completely uniform fluted texture over its surface. Additionally, conjured objects bear no flaws: Weapons have no dents or scratches, tools have no distinguishing marks, and cellphones all look like they just came out of their packaging.<br>The limit on the size of conjured objects appears to be that of the conjurer: nothing larger than the thaumaturge can be created. The conjurer must also have some degree of familiarity with the object he wishes to call forth. Simply working from a picture or imagination calls for a higher difficulty, while objects with which the character is intimately familiar (such as the knife described above) may actually lower the difficulty, at the Storyteller\u2019s discretion. When a player rolls to conjure something, the successes gained on the roll indicate the quality of the summoned object. One success yields a shoddy, imperfect creation, while five successes garner the caster a nearly perfect replica.\n\n"

Strike at the True Flesh invokes the very essence of the sorcerer\u2019s weapon, reducing it to the embodiment of its very definition (or, as the more classically minded would put it, invoking the Platonic form) while simplifying its target to a similarly basic level. The results of such an invocation are usually devastating on both a philosophical and practical level as weapon and victim momentarily lose all supernatural attributes.<br><b>System</b>: The effects of Strike at the True Flesh last for a number of turns equal to the number of successes rolled, and they end with the first successful attack that the character makes within this time period. The sword inflicts only the base amount of lethal damage that a weapon of its size and type would normally cause, disregarding all enhancements that it may have received (though augmentations to the wielder\u2019s strength or speed, such as Potence and Celerity, still have their normal effects, as do extra successes on the attack roll). However, all the target\u2019s supernatural defenses (including Fortitude) are likewise negated - he soaks the attack only with his base Stamina.

This set of techniques focuses on the symbolism of the sword as the ultimate extension of a trained warrior\u2019s body, drawing on the myths that various warrior traditions attached to their swords and daggers: European Crusaders and their blessed blades, the kris of Indonesian Pentjak-Silat practitioners, and Indian Ghurkas and their kukri knives, among others.

A vampire affected by this power might feel a physical rush as the thaumaturge heightens his Physical Attributes, might find himself suddenly looking more human, or may even find himself on the brink of frenzy as his stores of vitae are mystically depleted.<br><b>System</b>: Each success forces the subject to spend one blood point immediately in the way the caster desires (which must go towards some logical expenditure the target vampire could make, such as increasing Physical Attributes or powering Disciplines). Note that blood points forcibly spent in this manner may exceed the normal \u201cper turn\u201d maximum indicated by the victim\u2019s Generation.

In effect, he may temporarily lower his own Generation with this power. This power may be used only once per night.<br><b>System</b>: One success on the Willpower roll allows the character to lower his Generation by one step for one hour. Each additional success grants the Kindred either one step down in Generation or one hour of effect. Successes earned must be spent both to decrease the vampire\u2019s Generation and to maintain the change (this power cannot be activated again until the original application wears off). If the vampire is diablerized while this power is in effect, it wears off immediately and the diablerist gains power appropriate to the caster\u2019s actual Generation. Furthermore, any mortals Embraced by the thaumaturge are born to the Generation appropriate to their sire\u2019s original Generation (e.g., a Tenth-Generation Tremere who has reduced his effective Generation to Eighth still produces Eleventh-Generation childer).<br>Once the effect wears off, any blood over the character\u2019s blood pool maximum dilutes, leaving the character at his regular blood pool maximum. Thus, if a Twelfth-Generation Tremere (maximum blood pool of 11) decreased his Generation to Ninth (maximum blood pool 14), ingested 14 blood points, and had this much vitae in his system when the power wore off, his blood pool would immediately drop to 11.\n\n",

The subject must be visible to the thaumaturge and within 50 feet (15 meters).

Strike at the True Flesh invokes the very essence of the sorcerer\u2019s weapon, reducing it to the embodiment of its very definition (or, as the more classically minded would put it, invoking the Platonic form) while simplifying its target to a similarly basic level. The results of such an invocation are usually devastating on both a philosophical and practical level as weapon and victim momentarily lose all supernatural attributes.<br><b>System</b>: The effects of Strike at the True Flesh last for a number of turns equal to the number of successes rolled, and they end with the first successful attack that the character makes within this time period. The sword inflicts only the base amount of lethal damage that a weapon of its size and type would normally cause, disregarding all enhancements that it may have received (though augmentations to the wielder\u2019s strength or speed, such as Potence and Celerity, still have their normal effects, as do extra successes on the attack roll). However, all the target\u2019s supernatural defenses (including Fortitude) are likewise negated - he soaks the attack only with his base Stamina. If the negation of his powers and defenses renders the target unable to soak lethal damage, he cannot soak the attack at all. Body armor does protect against this attack, as it is a mundane form of defense."

Awakening of the Steel is one legacy of this preparedness, a path that some say began with the alchemists who studied in the forges of Toledo and Damascus. This set of techniques focuses on the symbolism of the sword as the ultimate extension of a trained warrior\u2019s body, drawing on the myths that various warrior traditions attached to their swords and daggers: European Crusaders and their blessed blades, the kris of Indonesian Pentjak-Silat practitioners, and Indian Ghurkas and their kukri knives, among others. The practitioner of Awakening of the Steel focuses on this symbolism as he uses the power of his blood to enhance his weapon and his skill.<br>A student of Awakening of the Steel finds that a keen understanding of both the form and the function of a blade is necessary for full mastery of this path. A character must have a level of either Melee or Crafts Ability equal to his level in Awakening of the Steel.<br>Those who practice this path also find that its lessons are tightly focused, perhaps to the point of overspecialization. The path is at its most effective with swords and knives, and the wielder can only extend its effects to other edged weapons.

A vampire affected by this power might feel a physical rush as the thaumaturge heightens his Physical Attributes, might find himself suddenly looking more human, or may even find himself on the brink of frenzy as his stores of vitae are mystically depleted.<br><b>System</b>: Each success forces the subject to spend one blood point immediately in the way the caster desires (which must go towards some logical expenditure the target vampire could make, such as increasing Physical Attributes or powering Disciplines). Note that blood points forcibly spent in this manner may exceed the normal \u201cper turn\u201d maximum indicated by the victim\u2019s Generation.

In effect, he may temporarily lower his own Generation with this power. This power may be used only once per night.<br><b>System</b>: One success on the Willpower roll allows the character to lower his Generation by one step for one hour. Each additional success grants the Kindred either one step down in Generation or one hour of effect. Successes earned must be spent both to decrease the vampire\u2019s Generation and to maintain the change (this power cannot be activated again until the original application wears off). If the vampire is diablerized while this power is in effect, it wears off immediately and the diablerist gains power appropriate to the caster\u2019s actual Generation. Furthermore, any mortals Embraced by the thaumaturge are born to the Generation appropriate to their sire\u2019s original Generation (e.g., a Tenth-Generation Tremere who has reduced his effective Generation to Eighth still produces Eleventh-Generation childer).<br>Once the effect wears off, any blood over the character\u2019s blood pool maximum dilutes, leaving the character at his regular blood pool maximum. Thus, if a Twelfth-Generation Tremere (maximum blood pool of 11) decreased his Generation to Ninth (maximum blood pool 14), ingested 14 blood points, and had this much vitae in his system when the power wore off, his blood pool would immediately drop to 11.\n\n",

The subject must be visible to the thaumaturge and within 50 feet (15 meters). Using this power prevents the caster from being blood-bound, but otherwise counts as if the vampire ingested the blood herself. This power is spectacularly obvious, and Camarilla princes justifiably consider its public use a breach of the Masquerade.\n\n",

One blood point creates enough acid to burn through a quarter-inch or half a centimeter of steel plate or three inches (seven centimeters) of wood.

Failure means the limb is permanently and completely crippled. Partial resistance is possible: One success indicates that the difficulty of any roll involving the use of the arm increases by two, though these effects are still permanent with regard to mortals. Two successes signify that difficulties increase by one. Vampires afflicted by this power may spend five blood points to rejuvenate atrophied limbs. Mortals are permanently crippled.

A potential victim may resist with a Stamina + Courage roll (difficulty 8), but must accumulate more successes than the caster\u2019s activation roll - it\u2019s an all-or-nothing affair. If the victim succeeds, he does not age at all. If he does not acquire more successes than the thaumaturge, he ages the full amount.

This requires one action for each projectile that the player wishes to block, and the character must be able to see the shot coming (Heightened Senses allows visual tracking of bullets). Each parrying attempt requires a ^Dexterity + Melee^ roll, with a difficulty determined by the speed of the projectile. Thrown objects have a difficulty of 6, arrows and crossbow bolts a difficulty of 7, and bullets a difficulty of 9. Each success subtracts one success from the attacker\u2019s attack roll.<br>Razor\u2019s Shield does not allow the character to parry ranged attacks that do not incorporate solid projectiles, such as flame, lightning, or spat blood.\n\n",
                    "# Level 5\n<b>Strike at the True Flesh</b><br>Although pacifists may find other uses for blades, a warrior knows that swords were created for one purpose: to carve an enemy\u2019s flesh into bloody ruin. Strike at the True Flesh invokes the very essence of the sorcerer\u2019s weapon, reducing it to the embodiment of its very definition (or, as the more classically minded would put it, invoking the Platonic form) while simplifying its target to a similarly basic level. The results of such an invocation are usually devastating on both a philosophical and practical level as weapon and victim momentarily lose all supernatural attributes.<br><b>System</b>: The effects of Strike at the True Flesh last for a number of turns equal to the number of successes rolled, and they end with the first successful attack that the character makes within this time period. The sword inflicts only the base amount of lethal damage that a weapon of its size and type would normally cause, disregarding all enhancements that it may have received (though augmentations to the wielder\u2019s strength or speed, such as Potence and Celerity, still have their normal effects, as do extra successes on the attack roll). However, all the target\u2019s supernatural defenses (including Fortitude) are likewise negated - he soaks the attack only with his base Stamina. If the negation of his powers and defenses renders the target unable to soak lethal damage, he cannot soak the attack at all. Body armor does protect against this attack, as it is a mundane form of defense."

                "description": "Although combat mastery is hardly the sorcerer caste\u2019s primary goal, they have a long tradition of standing ready to defend themselves and, if need be, assisting the warrior caste on the battlefield. Awakening of the Steel is one legacy of this preparedness, a path that some say began with the alchemists who studied in the forges of Toledo and Damascus. This set of techniques focuses on the symbolism of the sword as the ultimate extension of a trained warrior\u2019s body, drawing on the myths that various warrior traditions attached to their swords and daggers: European Crusaders and their blessed blades, the kris of Indonesian Pentjak-Silat practitioners, and Indian Ghurkas and their kukri knives, among others. The practitioner of Awakening of the Steel focuses on this symbolism as he uses the power of his blood to enhance his weapon and his skill.<br>A student of Awakening of the Steel finds that a keen understanding of both the form and the function of a blade is necessary for full mastery of this path. A character must have a level of either Melee or Crafts Ability equal to his level in Awakening of the Steel.<br>Those who practice this path also find that its lessons are tightly focused, perhaps to the point of overspecialization. The path is at its most effective with swords and knives, and the wielder can only extend its effects to other edged weapons. Any attempt to use a technique of this path on another edged weapon is at +1 difficulty.\n\n"

Wards may be placed on weapons, even bullets, though this usually works best on small-caliber weapons. Bullets often warp upon firing, however, and for a ward to remain intact on a fired round, the player needs five successes on the Firearms roll."

There is no use in pining for lost humanity or in secreting oneself away to study arcane lore; vampires are without honor or compassion. The role of a vampire is the role of a master.<br>The followers of this Path see the exercise of power and control as the best reason for vampiric existence. Control of the self and of the external world is the only goal worth pursuing. To this end, a vampire must develop her abilities, extend her influence and play her pawns. By bending the world to her will, the vampire creates order and stability. Every form of power, influence, or control can be used to further some end. Therefore, Unifiers seek all forms of power, whether political, material, or spiritual.<br>Unifiers follow their own insight when exercising their authority. Although this Path is highly concerned with temporal power, it is also quite spiritual; Unifiers are avid pursuers of wisdom and enlightenment. Of course, all such knowledge ultimately turns to the pursuit of personal power. By understanding oneself, it is possible to begin to describe the motivations of others. True understanding, therefore, allows the vampire to unlock the secrets of enemies and allies alike, to carefully dissect any situation and discern the most proper course of action. From such judgments, the vampire decides upon the most favorable means of taking or keeping control.<br>The followers of this Path are rightly feared and respected. No adherent to this Path tolerates weakness or failure; punishment is swift and often fatal. Indeed, punishment serves not only to remonstrate the offender, but as an example to others. Thus, Unifiers have no mercy or compassion. Sabbat packs with Unifier Ducti are Darwinian in the extreme.<br>Unifiers are consummate politicians and strategists. Although blood bonds and emotional ties can motivate followers, the pragmatic students of this philosophy recognize that such measures can be fought and compromised. Thus, vampires of this Path believe that control should only be woven through methods that cannot be subverted: Pain, rage, desire, and depravity are key among their tools. A recruit who serves out of loyalty can be bought; a follower who serves out of duty can be blackmailed; an adherent who serves out of love can be disillusioned. Therefore, fear and respect for power, anger, and hate directed towards one\u2019s enemies, the fulfillment of lust and the lessons of pain make the most persuasive directives.\n\n# Ethics\n<ul><li>Do not tolerate failure - including your own. Punish it visibly and harshly.</li><li>Be sporadic in your rewards. Drive your followers to excel, but never let them assume that reward follows excellence.</li><li>Strive for control by any means. Dominate the world around you and bend it to your will.</li><li>Use the most effective tool for any undertaking. Hate, fear, and anger are key among these tools, but feign benevolence.</li><li>Show respect to those in authority, but replace them when they falter.</li><li>Deal from a position of power. Do not show weakness.</li></ul>\n\n# History\nThe Path of Power and the Inner Voice supposedly started with a Lasombra by the name of Lord Marcus, in the early 16th century. The Path\u2018s constant push to develop power and influence led to many followers who devoutly supported the Sabbat in its early nights, and as such, many of the Path\u2018s adherents assumed positions of authority during the formation of the Sabbat. Even tonight, the Path is well-respected within the Sabbat, and some of its precepts have even started to gain grudging acceptance among the power-hungry and jaded elders of the Camarilla.<br>Modern nights have seen an explosion of membership in this Path. Though always popular, the Path has attracted many new followers from the expanding ranks of the Sabbat. The sheer ruthlessness and shrewdness of many of these recruits is responsible for the slow evolution of the Path from a respectable but dictatorial philosophy into a Path of iron-fisted, Machiavellian social tyranny.\n\n# Practices\nFollowers of the Path of Power and the Inner Voice do not have an organized association, but they do engage in many similar practices. All Unifiers participate in War Parties and blood hunts, often assuming roles of leadership. Various displays of willpower are a means to demonstrate power and self-mastery, so Unifiers participate in many such rituals or opportunities as well.\n\n# Followers\nUnifiers are driven, confident, and even megalomaniacal. The need for control combined with introspection makes followers of this Path into corrupt and brutish tyrants. Some followers of the Path espouse dictatorship, but the truly enlightened use martial philosophy and an understanding of psychology to incite their followers. The typical Unifier accepts no excuses, drives himself and his subjects mercilessly, and shows no pity or compassion for failure.\n\n# Following\nA Unifier accepts no defeat. The appearance of benevolence is useful, but all failure must be punished eventually. The follower of the Path must always strive to control the situations around him and heed his own judgment. Respect should be given to those in positions of authority, but those who falter must be cast down and replaced. Followers of this Path seek wealth, influence, and support. Rule should be achieved by any means necessary - when alliances or honor are useful, they are used, but otherwise, fear and hate are more appropriate. The Unifier constantly seeks out means of developing his own capabilities and furthering his own agenda.\n\n# Abilities\nLeadership, Intimidation, Politics, Subterfuge, and similar Abilities are highly appropriate to followers of this Path. Unifiers often make a study of some sort of combat prowess, be it Brawl or Melee, in order to back up their authority. Empathy can also highlight the way to inner awareness.\n\n# Preferred Disciplines\nDominate and Presence are most valued among the Unifiers for their ability to exert direct control. Unifiers place emphasis on other Disciplines according to their own means of gathering power. All Unifiers invariably seek to develop their natural Disciplines to their fullest potential."

            "description": "# Beliefs\nThose vampires who follow the Path of Night wholly accept their damnation; indeed, they believe that, as vampires, it is their preordained role to act as agents of damnation. Unlife is nothing without pain, and misery enjoys company. This Path is practiced largely by young Kindred of Clan Lasombra, who gladly mortify their own souls in the interests of bringing atrocity to the world.<br>The Path of Night borrows heavily from Catholic dogma, though it concerns itself more with abandonment and damnation than redemption. The vampire\u2019s purpose in unlife, according to this Path, is to scourge the Earth, to act as an agent of evil and, thus, ultimately to do the bidding of the greater powers that dictate good and evil alike. No one lives without original sin, and those who follow this Path are beholden to expose and exacerbate that sin. Life and unlife are varying states of damnation; those who fail to realize their full potential are lost sheep, suitable only for slaughter.<br>This is one of the most terrible Paths in existence, as it concerns itself with the outright and intentional persecution of others. Its followers are more than mere bullies or sadists, however. One who receives the curse of Caine is bound by fate and duty to wreak vengeance upon the Children of Seth. In so doing, vampires on this Path hope that, by fulfilling the roles meant for them, they can transcend those roles and find ultimate peace. This final goal aside, though, the Path of Night is a Path of hostility and antagonism, and the company of those who follow it is extremely hard to abide.\n\n# Ethics\n<ul><li>Leave no being untouched by your taint.</li><li>Tempt and horrify those around you; the weak will fall, while the strong will be tempered by your testing of them.</li><li>Inspire others to accept their inner darkness.</li><li>Experience every sensation imaginable, and then some.</li><li>Death is a means, not an end.</li><li>Kindred, as souls damned by God, fulfill their purpose by preying upon mortals.</li></ul>\n\n# History\nFew, if any, have certifiably chronicled this Path\u2019s inception or evolution. By varying accounts the outgrowth of medieval death cults, Satanic cabals, debased Methuselahs, or the practices upheld by Adam\u2019s first wife Lilith and her children, the Path of Night has been forsaken by most Kindred with any sense of Humanity at all. Some suspect a coterie of Lasombra known as the Black Angels foment dissension among the Clan, turning impressionable Keeper neonates down the Path\u2019s unwholesome trail.\n\n# Practices\nNo sin is too vile for a follower of this Path to indulge, and no trust is too sacred to break. Kindred on the Path of Night tie their fates very closely to mortals, who bear the brunt of their depredations. As harbingers of damnation, the Nihilists cull the secret fears and sorrows of humans around them, inflicting these terrors upon the kine as the whim takes them.<br>Ironically, vampires on this Path often have great reverence for those whom they perceive as truly \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cblessed\u201d. Indeed, one infamous Keeper, who plagued a family of witch-hunters down three generations and was finally destroyed by a scion of the line, is rumored to have praised his destroyer for her resolve.\n\n# Followers\nThis Path is upheld almost exclusively by Lasombra, though the Keepers find occasional converts among other Clans. Lasombra who follow this Path are held in low regard by many other Keepers, as there is no room for nobility on this Path. While most Lasombra maintain other codes of morality drawn from the Sabbat, the ones who follow this Path are true fiends.\n\n# Following\nVampires on the Path of Night terrorize their victims, a term which may apply to anyone to whom the Nihilist is drawn. Kindred on this Path are loath to kill - that removes potential targets, though they are not above doing so if the death may cause great grief to others or if preventing it would inconvenience their own existence. To some degree, the Nihilists shepherd the kine, showing them what may await them if they are unrepentant. However, no follower of this Path would openly admit such a thing. In their own minds, they are devils, pure and simple.\n\n# Abilities\nKindred on this Path specialize in Abilities that allow them to torment others. Brawl, Intimidation, Melee, and Medicine (for physiological knowledge) all have their value.\n\n# Preferred Disciplines\nFollowers of this Path cultivate Obtenebration for the sheer terror it inspires, as well as Potence for the pain it allows one to inflict."

The metaphysical, arcane members of Clan Tzimisce follow this Path, which focuses on defining and attaining the state of being beyond the curse of vampirism. Citing their transformative use of Vicissitude, the Tzimisce believe they have the potential to transcend the constraints of the flesh. Hearing Metamorphosist Fiends speak, however, reveals the true monstrosity of their philosophy. They believe that the next step is a state akin to apotheosis, and they will do anything - <i>anything</i> - to achieve it.<br>The Tzimisce are characteristically thorough in their study of this Path\u2019s ideals. By coordinating their experiments on living, dead, and undead subjects (as well as other curiosities they may come across, like werewolves or the errant faerie), the Fiends have formed complex theories as to precisely what the next step in vampiric transcendence is. The solitary and suspicious Tzimisce rarely compare notes, however, and the Path\u2019s development suffers as each follower spends much of her unlife learning the rudiments that other Kindred have already deciphered.\n\n# Ethics\n<ul><li>Learn the characteristics of all stages of life and death.</li><li>One should not concern oneself overly with mortals - they are a step below the Kindred, not above them.</li><li>Do not share knowledge with others, as it is too valuable to trust to flawed creatures.</li><li>Indulge the Beast and deny it; true comprehension of unlife requires a broad range of experience.</li><li>One should alter and augment one\u2019s body - changing the flesh may pave the way toward changing the soul.</li><li>Do not heed the needs or desires of others, as their lack of introspection may distract even the keenest intellect.</li></ul>\n\n# History\nThe Tzimisce have researched this Path in their solitary way for literally thousands of years. They have always been creatures of tremendous mystical potential; the followers of this Path seek to realize that potential. Followers of this Path relate very little to the world outside themselves, and many relate this fact to the inexorable decline of the Clan itself.\n\n# Practices\nMost Metamorphosists claim membership in the Sabbat but pay it little more than lip service, involved as they are in more esoteric pursuits. In truth, this Path predates any Sect, and Kindred committing themselves to it subscribe to beliefs and creeds far older than petty notions of Kindred politics.\n\n# Followers\nFollowers of the Path of Metamorphosis are truly some of the most alien creatures any Kindred could meet. Metamorphosists are cold, utterly inhuman, and exactingly scientific. Their concerns are metaphysical rather than ethical, and it is precisely this frame of mind that leads many to believe that the Metamorphosists have literally begun their transformation into something else. Some take this a step further by altering their flesh in various means until they no longer have a recognizable gender or look even remotely human.\n\n# Following\nMetamorphosists conduct all manner of bizarre experiments, most of which take place far from others\u2019 eyes. It is a distant, lonely philosophy, removed from any needs other than the matter of sustenance. Followers should be heedless of others around them, existing only to satisfy their personal concerns.\n\n# Abilities\nThis Path concerns itself almost exclusively with Knowledges, particularly those of Occult, Medicine, and Science. Many Metamorphosists also specialize Academics in areas such as philosophy and theology in hopes of uncovering secrets unexplored in larger fields of study.\n\n# Preferred Disciplines\nThe Tzimisce Metamorphosists favor attention to their unique powers of Vicissitude. Thaumaturgy and Auspex are also highly prized."

            "description": "# Beliefs\nVampires who follow the Path of Typhon have a truly sinister purpose in mind. Theophidians seek the resurrection of their patron and father, Set. Though most vampires view Set simply as a mythical member of the Third Generation, Theophidian doctrine teaches that Set was, in fact, a divine being even before his Embrace. Indeed, Theophidians view Caine as a lesser being than Set, and claim that Set in fact allowed Caine to Embrace him so that he might use the descendants of Caine to strike at his divine counterparts, such as the mythical Gaia and Lilith. In this manner Set and the Setites fulfill their place in the universe, acting as agents of entropy and breaking down the old so that the new may blossom.<br>Accordingly, this Path preaches the importance of influence and control. Many Setites on the surface appear to be little more than pimps, pushers, and fixers; in truth, they are much more. Setites commonly view other individuals as tools or resources to be used. By gaining control over others, the Setites may exploit them to fulfill their own ends. Thus, rather than owing those who provide them with information or services, the Setites reverse the role, and instead have their marks come to them first.<br>Followers of this Path revere Set as something more than a vampire - Set is attributed a deified status, almost a literal translation of the Egyptian god of the Underworld. Ways to achieve this reincarnation differ, and for this reason, the Followers of Set extend their influence in hopes of finding information wherever it resides.\n\n# Ethics\n<ul><li>Gather information, secret or otherwise, and learn how it applies to the resurrection of Set.</li><li>Contribute to the Clan\u2019s greater goal of reviving its slumbering master.</li><li>Bring others under your sway, increasing your influence and capability.</li><li>Subjugate the Beast, as its reckless wiles serve only itself.</li><li>Maintain a veil of secrecy, for others look poorly upon this Path\u2019s methods.</li><li>Look for Set\u2019s hidden signs and act upon them.</li></ul>\n\n# History\nTheophidians claim a history dating back to nights before the First City. Whether or not this is true is a matter of much debate, especially among detractors. Nevertheless, the widespread presence of human myths that mimic the relationship between Set and Osiris lends credence to its longevity. For millennia, the Theophidians have plied their degenerate trade from back alleys to holy temples and everywhere in between. Many leaders among the Kindred and kine alike owe their acquisition of power to the followers of this Path, though the prices they have paid are high.\n\n# Practices\nTheophidians support no Sect other than their own Clan, though some Setites have forsaken the resurrection of Set and actually oppose his quest from the ranks of the Sabbat. Many followers of this Path cultivate blood cults of devout followers and indenture legions of desperate individuals to themselves. While the Theophidians are not averse to doing \u201cdirty work\u201d themselves - quite the contrary - they reason that, with others serving their purposes, they can accomplish much more. Thus, followers of this Path play many roles: seekers, fixers, scholars, courtesans, and harvesters of souls.\n\n# Followers\nThe Theophidians are frequently social chameleons, given their need to move through many different circles. They are smooth, ingratiating, and wholly inspired by their greater cause. Followers of this Path rarely ask favors of others; they prefer to help satisfy the desires of others and then call in favors. It is this side that non-Setite Kindred see most frequently and despise; they publicly decry the vice-peddling and corruption of the Followers of Set as breaches of the Masquerade or the puppetry of the Ancients. The Setites know the truth, however: Other Kindred are loath to acknowledge the desires that a canny Theophidian can satisfy. Clever Setites have even managed to convince non-Setite Kindred to follow this Path after long periods of corruption, dependency, and debasement.\n\n# Following\nFollowers of the Path of Typhon are first and foremost seekers of arcane lore, though their keen social graces also make them silver-tongued diplomats. These Kindred are also insidious, working their way into existing vampire societies with serpentine fa\u00e7ades of false identities and cadres of loyal followers. The eldest Theophidian in a given locale often erects a temple to Set in some out-of-the-way place to better serve the slumbering god.\n\n# Abilities\nAny Ability that helps the Kindred achieve her end is prized by the followers of this Path. As such, the Theophidians have very diverse and capable members. Abilities of particular favor among the Setites include Empathy, Intimidation, Streetwise, Subterfuge, Performance, Academics, Investigation, and Politics.\n\n# Preferred Disciplines\nTheophidians are masters of the reptilian Discipline of Serpentis, though their dealings with others inspire them to pursue the Setite Clan Disciplines of Presence and Obfuscate."

            "description": "# Beliefs\nScholars of nights long past, in seeking keys to the nature of vampiric existence, pursued fragments of knowledge from the Book of Nod. Drawing upon the history from that book as well as other esoteric sources, Cainite scholars concluded that only Caine, as the first vampire, is the paragon of vampiric nature. The Noddists seek to become more like Caine, in order to discover the limits and powers of the undead form. By learning from Caine\u2019s example, the Noddists claim, one can understand the true nature of vampirism and how vampiric existence differs from one\u2019s mortal life.<br>Noddists seek knowledge and history, recording the experiences of Caine, so that they may learn from his example. To them, Caine\u2019s life reveals the mystery of the vampiric curse; by understanding the undead form, they transcend their mortal weaknesses. They prize any knowledge about the vampiric condition, but the writings and stories of the First Vampire form the core of Noddist lore. As Caine was marked and cast out from mortal society, the Noddists believe that he exemplifies most keenly the differences between vampires and humans. Therefore, this Path\u2018s adherents cast aside their humanity as inadequate and useless, emulating Caine\u2019s exile and seeking new rules to govern their predatory drives.<br>The heart of the Path of Caine lies in the exemplification of vampiric nature: The questions of existence, the limits of the vampiric form and the changes wrought by the Embrace all drive the Noddists into endless speculation, debate, and research. Scholarship and historical insight are valuable, but the vampire must simultaneously develop spiritually and physically, to explore the limits of his undead form. Diablerie serves as more than a simple theft of power; it allows the practitioner to learn from the experiences of other undead, thereby developing greater understanding. Other vampires lose themselves in attempts to save lost humanity or find meaning in obscure philosophy. The Path of Caine, instead, finds meaning in the fundamentals of vampirism.<br>The Path of Caine is demanding and rigorous; few vampires follow its tenets in the modern nights. This Path places a high emphasis on scholarship, insight, and personal discipline. With the eternal patience attributed to Caine, say the followers of the Path, comes the opportunity to slowly refine oneself.\n\n# Ethics\n<ul><li>Search for the history of Caine. Learn from his actions.</li><li>Develop your willpower and predatory instinct. The Beast, like the rest of the vampiric form, may be mastered.</li><li>Take the vitae of the unworthy so that you may become closer to Caine. Temper this accrual with an understanding of your own potential so that you do not take the Curse for granted.</li><li>Adapt to the needs of your new condition; cast aside your lost humanity.</li><li>Study your abilities and the abilities of Caine to discover what belongs within you. Examine the limits and meanings of vampirism.</li></ul>\n\n# History\nThe Path of Caine developed in the early 16th century as vampires sought new insights into personal enlightenment during the Renaissance. Many vampires felt the need for a system of self-improvement that circumvented the limitations of humanistic beliefs, as human morality conflicted with vampiric nature. This Path gained a great following over the next 200 years, as many vampires viewed Caine as an ideal figure. Following the Enlightenment, this Path began to decline in favor of newer Paths. Few vampires maintained the discipline and studiousness necessary to uphold this Path, so it dwindled to a small but devoted following.<br>The remaining Noddists maintained a respected place in the Sabbat and continued to recruit from the most intellectual and insightful prospects. As the modern Sabbat selects more fledglings based on their individual potential and achievement, this Path has experienced an influx of new followers.\n\n# Practices\nThis Path appeals to some of the most introspective and reflective of vampires, but all Sabbat subscribe to parts of the theory (if not the practice) of this Path. Followers focus on personal growth, but also lead missions to garner hidden knowledge and powerful elder vitae. Additionally, many of this Path\u2018s students often oversee and participate in rituals and plays celebrating the history of vampirism. Noddists are loath to Embrace randomly, instead choosing recruits from promising mortals. Recently, many Noddists have eschewed scholarship in favor of traveling, experiencing the world and emulating Caine\u2019s wanderings. Many of these \u201cadventurous\u201d Noddists travel the globe to chase bits of information and experience the variety of vampiric existence.\n\n# Followers\nNoddists are often reserved and educated, with a strong knowledge of history and a drive for self-awareness. Followers of the Path are not inquisitive in the sense of seeking deductive answers to problems; rather, they study traditions and historical events in hopes of finding solutions for their questions. Cainites who espouse this Path often display a great deal of self-mastery. Additionally, Noddists tend to engage in debate with other vampires, to discern how other Cainites experience the Curse. Noddists tend to assume positions of spiritual authority in the Sabbat, as Pack Priests or Bishops. Many other Cainites find followers of this Path haughty and vain.\n\n# Following\nSons and Daughters of Caine should always seek information regarding the vampiric condition, through experience, personal growth, and the pursuit of occult lore. Diablerie, development of Disciplines, and self-mastery are all valid means of refining the vampiric form. Noddists rarely engage in politics, choosing instead to acquire new information and experiences. They also serve as priests who lead vampires to seek awareness - and development - of their undead condition. Those on this Path lead by example, embracing their monstrous natures and striving to attune themselves to their differences from humans, then helping other vampires do the same. Noddists do not hesitate to share their insights, so that all vampires have the opportunity to become closer to Caine, though they hoard dangerous secrets to prevent misuse.\n\n# Abilities\nVampires who adhere to the Path of Caine are studious and philosophical. Followers primarily favor Knowledges - especially Occult - but Noddists are expected to be capable of developing the vampiric form to its greatest potential, so Survival, Melee, and Athletics are encouraged. Additionally, those who would engage in debate prefer Expression, Subterfuge, and Leadership.\n\n# Preferred Disciplines\nFollowers of the Path of Caine prefer those Disciplines considered \u201cnatural\u201d to vampires, such as Auspex and Presence. Disciplines that augment the physical form - Celerity, Fortitude, and Potence - are particularly valuable. Some Noddists dislike the use of Disciplines that are not expressly noted in the Book of Nod, such as Thaumaturgy and Serpentis, claiming that these Disciplines do not conform to Caine\u2019s development. Other followers of the Path claim that such Disciplines simply represent a heightened mastery of the vampiric condition. Most Cainites of this Path learn only the Disciplines listed by Caine in the early fragments of the Book of Nod."

            "description": "# Beliefs\nConsidered heretical by most Cainites of the Sabbat, the fragments of Lilith\u2019s teachings - sometimes erroneously referred to as the Lilith Cycle - showcase an elaborate history and an alternate tale of Creation itself. Cast out from the first garden for the crimes of elevating herself with the Fruits of Knowledge and Life, and for seeking to be equal to both man and God, Lilith wandered the unformed and barren world, becoming a power of creation equaling the deities of old. Through tribulation and pain she discovered the ways of survival; by fire and thorn she created her own garden, a mirror of the suffering and enlightenment that she endured. The architect of Caine\u2019s power, the creator of magick, and the mother to gods, Lilith watered the seeds of wisdom with her own blood, which empowered anyone to walk through the fire and swim through the frost to come to the revelation of ultimate freedom and self-empowerment.<br>Claiming followers among vampires and other denizens of the hidden world, the Bahari practice the ancient ways handed down by Lilith. By following the image of the mother-goddess, they raise themselves from the status of children. Like a parent disciplining an errant child, Lilith passes on a legacy of pain that teaches, and so the Bahari seek to overcome the weaknesses of their blind, helpless births, ascending to understanding and power. By walking in fire, impaling themselves on thorns and blades, suffering deprivation, and plunging into icy water, the Bahari excite their bodies and minds to true sensation, and open their consciousness to the entirety of the world. From the dizzying heights of comprehension, at the needlepoint of pain, they learn the true measure of creation, that they may take the formless stuff of the world and cast it in a new image.<br>Make no mistake, the Bahari have little room for compassion or conscience. They fully believe that one must grasp the blade of enlightenment - and suffer its lacerations - before rising to the truth. Those who do not have the will or the insight to learn through suffering are chaff, cast aside sadly but unhesitatingly. No time or resource is wasted on those who do not have the overpowering need to suffer, change, and grow. The Hierophants, the vampire-priests of Lilith, choose those who have heard Lilith\u2019s song and punish, flagellate, and excoriate them until they arrive on the cusp of seething awareness. Only then are the tears brushed away with lover\u2019s care, the wounds comforted, and the supplicants brought into the fullness of Lilith\u2019s glorious Path.\n\n# Ethics\n<ul><li>Only through pain are we elevated.</li><li>Be teacher, torturer, and lover to any who seek enlightenment.</li><li>Practice what you learn. Wisdom is meaningless unless it accompanies action.</li><li>Cultivate a garden, that you may show the power of your own creation.</li><li>Seek out those on the border of awareness and initiate them.</li><li>Gather with your brothers and sisters to share your learning and anguish.</li></ul>\n\n# History\nAccording to apocryphal tales, the cult of Lilith started when a vampire Methuselah, searching for ancient artifacts in Africa some millennia ago, discovered strange writings purported to tell of the Dark Mother. Although this Cainite could not acquire the artifacts, he carried with him the knowledge of what he had seen. Soundly defeated by the mortal and demonic guardians of the writings, he retreated to gather others to him with the knowledge and insight to delve into the mysteries pieced together from the fragments. Over the years, followers of the Path of Lilith slowly spread their archaic knowledge, drawing in small numbers of erudite and mystically curious vampires. The Path eventually took on aspects of religion as it absorbed the rituals and ceremonies of its followers\u2019 native lands.<br>The Path of Lilith never had very much of a following in the Sabbat, where the antithetical Path of Caine took sway, but enough followers existed to ensure that the Path survived. Indeed, even some elders of the Camarilla came to follow the Path. As rumors of Gehenna grow, more vampires are drawn to the apocryphal teachings of this Path. The visions of Caine as a blundering fool, cursed with incredible power that he refuses to understand, draw together vampires who seek an alternate means to survive the End Times. Through the auspices of the Dark Mother, they hope to rise above their Cainite nature and become untouchable to the Antediluvians.\n\n# Practices\nModem Bahari inherit many of the traditions of their ancient forebears. The followers of this Path rarely discard rituals or beliefs, for only true understanding of all of the world\u2019s mysteries can unlock the door to enlightenment. As such, the Bahari employ many and varied rites of worship. They often cultivate the hidden knowledge of alien cultures, and they are quick to absorb and adapt new and different occult practices. Because of this openness, Bahari engage in a loose network of vampires who trade lore and mystical knowledge, even dealing with wizards, ghosts, and other keepers of ancient secrets. Bahari often practice rituals that are bizarre even by the standards of the Sabbat, and though they are loyal as long as they may continue to practice their rites, the final loyalty of all Bahari is ultimately to themselves.\n\n# Followers\nBahari live fast-paced, hectic unlives, constantly striving for the next change and the next learning experience. Anything that shocks or outrages the sensibilities of others is fair game, since there is always the hope of pushing someone beyond the boundaries of the banal. Bahari cherish the development of personal understanding, so followers of this Path can be found equally among the squalid and the wealthy. When moving among mortals, Bahari are flamboyant and mysterious. In their ceremonies, they often wear flowing, open cloaks and ceremonial masks of wood or bone.<br>Contrary to some beliefs, this Path is not exclusively followed by women, although they do make up a majority of its practitioners. Anyone who throws away the caul of childish ignorance for painful maturity is welcome in the circle of Lilith.\n\n# Following\nA Lilin breaks with convention, flouting \u201caccepted society\u201d in order to force others to re-evaluate their views of the world. With the branding-iron and the scourge, the Cainite brings painful lessons that, if survived, make the postulant stronger. Those who hover on the edge of awareness are watched carefully for the final soul-wrenching revelation that brings them strength. To visit pain and even death is the greatest gift that can be given, for through these trials the individual comes to understand herself. Each must discover her own inward seeds of Knowledge and Life, so as to become a universe unto herself and an architect of creation. The garden, the symbol of life shaped and cultivated with care, is the manifestation of the Bahari\u2019s devotion to expressing what she has created and learned.\n\n# Abilities\nMedicine, an understanding of the body in order to dispense pain without killing, is first and foremost among a Lilin\u2019s skills. As mystics of the ancient secrets, Occult is crucial. Academics and Science are also valuable tools in the search for truth.\n\n# Preferred Disciplines\nLilith is said to have invoked various powers in herself as she walked the unformed earth, powers that aided in her survival. Bahari often emulate these powers, focusing upon the Disciplines of Animalism, Celerity, Fortitude, and Obfuscate."

            "description": "# Beliefs\nThe Path of the Bones, it is believed, grew out of a warped code upheld by the morbid vampires who sired the Giovanni: Human, Kindred, or otherwise, every being sooner or later ends up in death\u2019s arms. The most ardent followers of this Path espouse \u201cgiving oneself over to the comprehension of life\u2019s inevitable end\u201d. Vampires who follow this Path seek the knowledge of precisely what death is: Is it simply the end of life? The transition of the soul to what lies after life? Is it the end of the soul\u2019s desire to exist? These questions haunt the followers of the Path of the Bones each night.<br>Many vampires believe that the Path of the Bones is a degenerate Path that encourages followers to participate in all manner of murder and deviance. Those who uphold the Path and those who are familiar with it, however, know that it involves itself with a pursuit of life\u2019s - and unlife\u2019s - meaning. Followers of the Path seek to understand death\u2019s nature and purpose, and thus the roles individuals play in the greater scheme of the world. Mortality is inevitable, except for vampires, who have somehow managed to cheat the cycle.<br>Kindred nature, however, is generally outside the avenues this Path explores. It is truly a scholar\u2019s code, as the Kindred who follow it forsake even their own comfort to advance their understanding of mortality\u2019s mysteries. These Kindred are not necessarily cruel - they merely value comprehension more than human life.<br>At its simplest, the Path of the Bones seeks to define not only what death is, but also its meaning to those who have escaped it. It is a Path of knowledge and power, and many who support it learn to wield great influence over the living and dead alike. Many among the Path become quite erudite in the ways of ghosts, but even these odd beings fail to answer many of the Gravediggers\u2019 questions - what, for example, happens to a ghost that resolves its psychic struggle or discorporates into the void?\n\n# Ethics\n<ul><li>Study death in all its permutations.</li><li>Determine when death occurs; define it.</li><li>Search for a purpose for death and the life that prefaces it.</li><li>Quantify the differences of death by various causes.</li><li>Achieve a comfort with death and unlife - distinguish between damnation and salvation.</li><li>Hasten death\u2019s arrival, should it seem to be unnaturally delayed.</li></ul>\n\n# History\nThis Path grew out of a moral code upheld by the Cappadocians, whom the Giovanni destroyed in their bid for greater power. A select few Giovanni saw more than a means to an end in their practice of Necromancy, and upheld the rituals and studies of their forebears. Although the Path is not widely practiced among the Clan, followers of its precepts pioneered most of the Giovanni\u2019s advances in Necromancy.\n\n# Practices\nElder members of Clan Giovanni follow this Path, as do those with a sincere interest in improving their necromantic knowledge for a purpose other than temporal power. Giovanni who uphold the Path of the Bones rarely deal with mortals, as their grim inquisitiveness often proves fatal for mortals with whom they come in contact.\n\n# Followers\nVampires on this Path are genuinely curious, wishing to learn exactly what purpose individuals serve. Thanatology is more a science than a philosophy to Kindred on the Path of the Bones. This Path is quite introspective, and greedy Giovanni rarely follow it, preferring the more materially comfortable outlook of Humanity. Gravediggers support the Giovanni family primarily through the knowledge they bring it, rather than through advancing the political aims of the Clan.\n\n# Following\nVampires who subscribe to the tenets of the Path of the Bones should be detached yet inquisitive. Although they are not cavalier about death, Gravediggers seldom aid anyone about to die, preferring to watch and learn. Less fatalistic vampires may take issue with this, and the Kindred on this Path will not act against them should they seek to aid the dying individual. Obviously, their time has not yet come.\n\n# Abilities\nKindred on this Path naturally specialize in those proficiencies that advance their macabre research. Knowledges are favored, particularly in the realms of Medicine, Occult, and Science.\n\n# Preferred Disciplines\nFollowers of this Path obviously favor Necromancy, and also refine their aptitude with Auspex. As well, certain elders of the Path are rumored to have developed unique mystic arts related to the study of death."

            "description": "# Beliefs\nIn a world rife with corruption, malevolence, and insanity, some vampires find direction through a firm and unyielding code of personal conduct. These vampires do not delve into philosophical questions of existence or wanton indulgence of their monstrous sides. Instead, they focus upon one singular principle: honor. Order, fairness, and duty are the watchwords of these undead, and though still monstrous, they abide by standards of conduct that are rigidly understandable.<br>To a follower of this Path, unlife must be given direction and purpose. These vampires choose honor as their guiding hand. By focusing on firm rules and personal boundaries, the Knights keep the rage of the Beast at bay. Accepting a duty and fulfilling its obligations provides the Knights with goals to achieve. Bound by their codes of honor, these vampires uphold causes with the utmost devotion, even to the ends of their unlives.<br>Make no mistake; the vampires who follow this Path are not compassionate or humane in any sense. Indeed, they see humans as little more than chattel or food, and undeserving of the considerations of honor that are bestowed upon other vampires. Even so, a Knight will never willingly break his given word or renege on an agreement, as doing so would be a disgrace to personal honor. The subject of commitment matters little to a follower of this Path. It is the strength of the commitment and the unyielding determination that is important.<br>Many of the beliefs of the followers of this Path mirror the feudal codes of chivalry or the bushido of the samurai. Knights gladly suffer Final Death before showing cowardice or betraying their allies. Similarly, this Path\u2019s soldiers uphold the policies of their Sects and organizations with fanatical zeal. Pitted against an unyielding or recalcitrant foe, a solitary Knight is a fatalistic and deadly warrior.\n\n# Ethics\n<ul><li>Always keep your word and honor your agreements.</li><li>Never show cowardice. Overcome your fears.</li><li>Duty comes before personal matters.</li><li>Treat your equals and betters fairly and equitably. The dishonorable are beneath your contempt.</li><li>Always repay your debts.</li><li>Support your comrades-at-arms in all things, except where they counsel treachery.</li></ul>\n\n# History\nThe Path of Honorable Accord grew out of bygone nights, as vampires of the Dark Ages grappled with the problems of human morality by finding a harsh and unyielding code of conduct to replace the ethics of mankind. Sabbat followers of the Path turned their loyalty to the idealism of the Sect and the letter of the Code of Milan, in the process acquiring the moniker \u201cfollowers of the Code\u201d. There are also some Camarilla Archons and Alastors who follow the Path, loyal agents reserved for the most dangerous or difficult missions. A rare few Camarilla elders, primarily Ventrue, hold on to the precepts of this Path from their nights of vampiric, medieval chivalry.<br>Bound by loyalty to the ideals of their Sects, combined with a strong sense of duty and honor, the Knights fought to uphold the unity of both the Camarilla and the Sabbat over the centuries. Now, the Path of Honorable Accord forms the backbone of the Sabbat. The dedicated Knights are the core of the Sect, serving the ideals of the Sabbat with inhuman devotion.\n\n# Practices\nFollowers of the Path of Honorable Accord have always placed a high value on ritual and ceremony. As a whole, the followers of the Path seek to knit together disparate factions under the common banner of loyalty to a cause. Although alternately ignored or derided by followers of other Paths, the Knights are a stern example of the best qualities of any vampire, and they cannot be faulted by their brethren. Knights do not often take leadership positions (as they find the political duplicity appalling), though they are at the forefront of many battles, showing courage and discipline unmatched by any other soldiers among the undead.\n\n# Followers\nKnights are by turns cold and aloof, yet honorable and trustworthy. A Knight never goes back on his word and always honors his agreements. He does not shirk his duty or flee from battle. Still, he is far from humane: The Knight sees humans as a resource, just as another warrior might see a fine warhorse as admirable but far from an equitable associate. Many of this Path\u2019s followers display a grim and taciturn image, but the Knights are capable of humor and joviality - they simply find that duty outweighs personal gratification.\n\n# Following\nA follower of the Path of Honorable Accord must always keep honor foremost in his mind. A Knight cannot act rashly or in haste; he must always be aware of the nature and consequences of his actions. The devout student of this Path must hold onto courage and discipline at all times while he seeks to dispense justice and fairness. The true Knight fights and dies for his cause.\n\n# Abilities\nKnights study Melee, Brawl, and Athletics. Leadership and Expression are valued assets, as the Knight is often called upon to mediate disputes fairly. Similarly, Investigation and Law can help to discern truth and justice.\n\n# Preferred Disciplines\nFortitude and Presence are considered the epitome of the Knightly way; these vampires are stalwart in defense and eloquent in discourse. Since so many Knights follow a martial destiny in the turbulent modern nights, Potence is fairly common as well. The Salubri <i>antitribu</i> of the Sabbat also develop the puissant abilities of Valeren."

            "description": "# Beliefs\nThe Path of Cathari sprang from the Catharist heresy of the Middle Ages. A dualistic philosophy, Cathar doctrine holds that the world was created in equal parts by a good (\u201clight\u201d) creator responsible for virtue and spirit, and an evil (\u201cdark\u201d) creator who fashioned the material world and its vices. The original Cathars believed the soul to be the root of all that is pure in humanity, while the material body was a shell in the corrupt physical world. Cathars pointed to the noble aspects of the spirit - compassion, sacrifice, honesty, and the like - as proof that the only true good lay in the ephemeral. The material world, with its suffering and misery, bore obvious flaws and imperfections. After much persecution, this dualistic doctrine vanished from the mortal world, crushed by papal declarations of heresy. Over the years, the vampires who favored tenets of the philosophy adopted it as their own.<br>According to the vampires who follow this Path, the undead are minions of the evil creator, given eternal existence to tempt others with the lures of the material world. Followers of the Path believe that they fulfill a destiny as creatures tied to the physical world through vampiric immortality. Because vampires have been denied the spiritual realms of death, the Albigensians reason that they must serve the vices of the physical realm. Therefore, they seek to spread evil and corruption, seeing iniquity as their natural state.<br>The Albigensians have perfected a code of evils in which to indulge, however. Theirs is not a Path of pointless amorality. Taking the beliefs of the original Cathar priests and twisting them, these vampires deliberately search for means of spreading evil. They pursue sins of greed, lust, and pride avidly. Cathars seek material wealth and comforts, and they encourage others to do the same. A vampire can serve his proper purpose only by embracing the flaws inherent to his form and to the world, and accepting his duties as a purveyor of vice. Followers of the Path of Cathari thus ironically find spirituality in depravity.\n\n# Ethics\n<ul><li>Indulge in vice. Wealth, sensuality, and material power are hallmarks of the physical world.</li><li>Lead others to temptation. It is your role to promote the depravity of the world.</li><li>Grant the Curse of Caine to those with great passion. Undeath is an evil curse, but those with great conviction can use it well.</li><li>The entire material world and its denizens are corrupt. Expect betrayal and wickedness.</li><li>Your role as a creature of evil is predestined. Accept it and fulfill your purpose.</li><li>Death simply leads to reincarnation. Mortals return after you kill them. However, you should avoid Final Death, since you will return as a mortal if you die.</li></ul>\n\n# History\nThe Path of Cathari grew out of the aftermath of the Albigensian Crusade in the 13th century. The Manicheanist beliefs in dualism influenced some members of the Church, leading to a 30-year war that many believe led to the creation of the mortal Inquisition. After Albigensian vampires resurfaced following the crusade, they developed this moral system out of the logical consequences of their philosophy, seeing vampires as tied to the mortal world and therefore purveyors of evil, while the spirits of humans possessed the only potential for good. Soon, many vampires took it upon themselves to fulfill their \u201cduty\u201d as providers of the mortal world\u2019s corruption. Over the intervening years, the Path changed to include broader philosophies and less formal religious overtones. The Path continued to prove adaptable, keeping the core belief of vampires as traffickers in the vices of the material world. Quite a few vampires find purpose in the business of pleasure - and damnation.\n\n# Practices\nThe Albigensians lead others to temptation, despoiling the purity of the spirit. Neonates and elders alike can be found among the Albigensians. Many practitioners see the fast-paced, decaying modern world as a sign of success for the forces of the evil creator, and they seek out ever more challenging converts among mortals and vampires alike.\n\n# Followers\nAlbigensians are hedonistic and impulsive, but they believe that they serve a purpose. The followers of this Path are not lazy; rather, they undertake their duties with fanatical abandon. Each Albigensian considers it his duty to embody the vices of the material world and to share those comforts and pleasures with others. The Cathari encourage others to explore their monstrous natures and to spread hedonism among mortals.\n\n# Following\nCathari are usually quite passionate, devoted to vulgarity and pleasure. They see the mortal world as a vast playground wherein they may satiate their base urges and encourage others to do likewise. Believing themselves to be agents of immorality, the followers of this Path are often highly social, befriending and using others to serve their sinful purposes.\n\n# Abilities\nFollowers of the Path of Cathari indulge freely in vices and materialism, and they seek to spread these excesses. Thus, Social Abilities like Subterfuge and Streetwise are most useful. Some Albigensians also use Finance and Bureaucracy to earn money, making their unlives more luxurious. A few of the more studious followers of the Path indulge in Occult knowledge and Academics in order to study the roots of the Path.\n\n# Preferred Disciplines\nAlbigensians prefer Disciplines that allow them to fulfill their grim purpose. Dominate and Presence are most valued for the ability to coerce mortals into cooperation. They regard the Discipline of Animalism highly as well, due to its reflection in Biblical powers, from which the followers of this Path take some of their beliefs."

            "description": "# Beliefs\nInspired by Hinduism and upheld predominantly by vampires of the Ravnos Clan, the Path of Paradox concerns itself with the vampires\u2019 karmic duty to continue the grand cycle of ages. According to the Path of Paradox, Kindred are locked perpetually outside the illusory cycle of the universe (maya). Whereas most beings are reincarnated through samsara, a continual \u201centanglement\u201d in the cycle of rebirth, Kindred have eluded that cycle. Every individual has his own purpose, or svadharma, according to the Path of Paradox, although vampires, excluded from the cycle, have lost theirs. In place of the dharma they once followed, each Kindred must now try to advance maya, hopefully understanding it in the process and finally penetrating the great illusions that shroud Ultimate Truth from their eyes.<br>The means by which the Ravnos undertake this cyclical advancement, however, is by selective deception. Other vampires look upon the Ravnos as untrustworthy, and can hardly be expected to take the advice of the Deceivers. As such, the Ravnos have had to resort to elaborate ruses in order to get other vampires - or, indeed, anyone with whom they come in contact at all - to undertake a course of action. Ravnos vampires see their undead state as a curse, like many other Kindred do. However, the Ravnos believe this is due to their failure to understand maya. Other Kindred, also removed from the karmic wheel, often fail to realize the necessity of their return to the cycle. Shilmulo understand this - and expedite their return by destroying them.\n\n# Ethics\n<ul><li>Embrace only if absolutely necessary, and then only from the jati (family line).</li><li>Interpret the svadharma of others and aid them in their fulfillment of it.</li><li>Destroy other Kindred, for they are unnatural to maya.</li><li>Erase karmic debt, dispel maya\u2019s illusions and return to the samsara.</li><li>Use deception to achieve your ends, as others bear the fault of distrust.</li><li>Confuse the Antediluvians by returning their childer to the cycle.</li></ul>\n\n# History\nThis Path arose among the Ravnos during the latter nights of the Roman Empire. The deceit the Ravnos command is even believed by some to have played a major role in the collapse of the empire. The Path, according to many Ravnos, had become debased shortly after Rome\u2019s collapse and had remained so for hundreds of years until a stirring (and secret) event contrived to encourage the Ravnos to rethink their ways.\n\n# Practices\nIt is too simple a conceit to say that the Ravnos destroy vampires and burn karma. In fact, the Path of Paradox is arduous and demanding. Many of the Ravnos\u2019 deceptions are, in reality, complicated tests designed to cause the subject to reveal hidden aspects of herself. Thus, the Ravnos travel the world, ousted by ignorant Kindred who fail to realize the necessity of the Shilmulo\u2019s duties.\n\n# Followers\nMost followers of this Path are Ravnos, though small numbers of Malkavians and Gangrel adhere to the Path. Increasingly cosmopolitan Kindred have surfaced among the Ravnos Clan, indicating that either the Ravnos pay little heed to their code or that jati are more extended than one might think.\n\n# Following\nKindred on the Path of Paradox commonly hold other vampires in contempt, believing that they ignorantly or arrogantly refuse to seek their reintroduction to the cycle. As such, the Ravnos have taken the responsibility upon their shoulders to do it for them. This may require concocting complex webs of deception in order to ascertain what a given person\u2019s svadharma is, or simply destroying a vampire and placing her back in the cycle, where a new svadharma awaits.\n\n# Abilities\nKindred on this Path focus on Abilities that allow them to gain advantage over others, such as Alertness, Empathy, Subterfuge, Stealth, and Investigation.\n\n# Preferred Disciplines\nFollowers of this Path practice Chimerstry in order to dupe their subjects and as a means of manipulating the illusions intrinsic to maya. Shilmulo favor Fortitude as well, to protect themselves from their subjects\u2019 ire. Many also master Auspex, with which they may better divine hidden secrets."

            "description": "# Beliefs\nVampires are the ultimate hunters - immortal and invulnerable. The Beast Within is merely the expression of the predator\u2019s instinct. To deny one\u2019s atavistic impulses is to go against the dictates of nature, or so this Path\u2019s followers believe. A vampire can only survive by adhering to her inner character and accepting the monstrous drives that accompany the unliving state. Though the Beasts do not revel in their predations, neither do they avoid them. By learning to accept the role of hunter, thereby acknowledging the proper role of the unliving, a vampire becomes like an animal: feral, predatory, but ultimately in her proper place.<br>A follower of this Path feels that the Beast is a natural part of being a vampire and that its needs must be satiated. Still, the vampire is intelligent, and a cunning hunter is a more effective one. Therefore, it is important to strike a balance between Beast and Man - the feral cunning and vicious instincts of the vampire are excellent survival tools, tempered by the reasoning and insight of the mind. By satiating the Beast\u2019s urges from time to time, the vampire ironically gains a greater degree of personal control.<br> Vampires on the Path of the Feral Heart (sometimes called the Path of the Beast) have little use for the trappings of civilization or education. Modern transportation and weaponry is unnecessary, for the unliving form provides the necessary tools to stalk and kill. Subterfuge and politics are trivial concerns; politicking does not bring blood to one\u2019s throat. Vampires are made to hunt and kill, and the followers of this Path excel at both.\n\n# Ethics\n<ul><li>Survival is your first concern.</li><li>Politics or technology simply get in the way of the hunt.</li><li>Learn to strike a balance with your Beast. Engage in the brutal actions necessary to survive, but retain your intelligence and cunning.</li><li>The \u201cnatural world\u201d is an illusion. All things must live according to their forms, and even civilization is natural because it is the form of humanity.</li><li>Although fire can kill you, you must master your fear so that you can kill those who would use it against you.</li><li>Whether running alone or with a pack, your loyalties must be absolute. You have no time for shifting allegiances.</li></ul>\n\n# History\nThe Path of the Feral Heart seems to have grown out of ancient codes by which vampiric berserkers accepted their animalistic nature. Espoused originally by the Gangrel, the Path spread to a few other vampires who learned to elevate their predatory ways. This Path was never a popular one, but its constituency remained constant throughout the ages. The Path has changed relatively little over the years. Beasts see no real need to \u201cadapt\u201d the Path to a more modern age.\n\n# Practices\nBeasts have no real organization, and they rarely engage in any sort of concerted rituals or traditions. Some few nomads, though, exist as wandering hunters. When Beasts meet, they often indulge in the Gangrel practice of sharing stories or indulging in a little practice combat. Beasts also serve as frighteningly effective assassins; their loyalty, once given, is unquestionable. Beasts who feel that a particular individual is a threat to themselves or their pack are relentless in hunting and destroying the opposition.\n\n# Followers\nMost Beasts care little for fashion or attire, instead choosing functional clothing that serves well while hunting. Some Beasts even disdain ornamentation and clothing completely, though these are rare. Followers of this Path often have a great attunement to their senses, and such individuals are often noted carefully listening to and watching their surroundings at all times, or even staying in constant slow motion and sniffing at the air so as to avoid hidden adversaries. Many Gangrel follow this Path, and they invariably have animalistic features that they do not bother to conceal.\n\n# Following\nBeasts must always recognize and indulge in their predatory natures. Followers of this Path therefore strive to develop their prowess as hunters. A Beast has little desire to use the trappings of technology, believing that the vampiric form provides him with all of the powers necessary to survive. Indulgence in politics is frowned upon, as there are more important matters to handle; force is a simpler and often more effective tool. Mercy and compassion have no place in the predator\u2019s heart, and enemies must be harshly destroyed while allies and packmates are protected, as they in turn protect the individual. Beasts do not kill whimsically, but when killing is necessary, there must be no hesitation.\n\n# Abilities\nNot surprisingly, most Beasts are highly skilled trackers and hunters. Survival is paramount among these vampires, as well as Brawl and Athletics. Animal Ken is common, though a Beast is just as likely to feed upon an animal as to emulate it. Because they are in touch with their inner natures, many followers of this Path develop a great deal of Empathy - not that they feel any pity for their prey, but rather they intuitively understand the motives of their victims. Intimidation is also fairly common, for the simmering fury just below the surface of the Beast\u2019s outward calm is truly terrifying.\n\n# Preferred Disciplines\nDisciplines are a matter of survival for followers of this Path. Animalism is useful in learning from lesser predators and for feeding. Fortitude is valued, as Beasts must be rugged enough to survive any conditions. The natural weapons and hunting benefits of Protean are likewise considered valuable, and some Beasts learn Obfuscate or Celerity to become faster and cagier hunters."

            "description": "# Beliefs\nThis Path is practiced almost exclusively by the assassins of Clan Assamite, although only vampires who demonstrate true loyalty to the Clan learn its harsh code. The founding principle of this Path explains that the children of Caine (or Khayyin, as the Assamites refer to him) are wicked failures, fit primarily to bring the brood of Haqim (the Assamites\u2019 name for their own Clan founder) closer to \u201cthe One\u201d, a state of mystical transcendence. Haqim instructs his childer to salvage or strike down Khayyin\u2019s other childer to destroy the taint they inflict on the world.<br>Assamites on this Path follow two basic precepts. First and foremost, the Clan seeks to convince other Kindred of their flawed, cursed nature, and thus convert them to the service of those on the Path. Kindred as a whole are a blight upon the earth, and only by upholding Haqim\u2019s righteous code can they redeem themselves. Should vampires resist attempts at conversion, the Assamites kill them. Before they were cursed, Assamites would diablerize their victims, using the blood of the fallen to lower their Generations and thus return to Haqim\u2019s bounty. Now, unable to drink the blood of other vampires, they instead collect blood from vampires as payment, using that to follow Haqim\u2019s directives until the night when the curse upon them can be lifted. Although they are not inherently psychotic murderers, Assamites on the Path of Blood place little value on the unlives of other Kindred, and must have good reason not to slay most vampires with whom they come in contact. Vampires on this Path pose a serious threat to other Kindred around them, and do not frequently associate with non-Assamite Kindred. Blood is blood, however, and Assamites are not so fatuous as to disregard the value of the vast web of Kindred society.<br>Few young Assamites follow this Path or even know of its existence - Clan Assamite conspires to keep its beliefs secret from most other Kindred of the world. Hundreds of years ago, the Assamites\u2019 bloodthirsty ways united all other Children of Caine against them, and they are loath to face the concerted opposition of Khayyin\u2019s bastard brood again. As such, only the most accomplished and able Assamites learn this Path\u2019s tenets.\n\n# Ethics\n<ul><li>Faithfully follow the teachings of Haqim.</li><li>Mortals are beneath the notice of vampires. Feed from them only when necessary.</li><li>Lose no opportunity to obtain Kindred blood of any Generation. The power of the Blood shall ensure the clan\u2019s victory.</li><li>Withstand the Beast\u2019s fury - failing to master oneself results in lessened prowess.</li><li>Seek knowledge that may aid the Clan in its war on the cursed spawn of Khayyin.</li><li>Extend the glory of Haqim\u2019s cause to other Kindred. Should they refuse, use them to further your own journey back to Khayyin\u2019s grace.</li></ul>\n\n# History\nThe Assamites practiced an early version of this Path for hundreds of years before the formations of the Camarilla and Sabbat. Their bloodlust led them into open conflict with powerful elder Kindred, who desperately sought to stifle the marauding diablerists. The Assamites found themselves in the same situation as the Anarchs during the time of the Anarch Revolt, and the Camarilla levied a curse on the Clan, making it impossible for the Assamites to consume Kindred vitae. For centuries, the Clan have followed a debased version of the Path, crippled by its members\u2019 inability to commit diablerie directly.\n\n# Practices\nThe fatal nature of this Path with regard to other Kindred stands behind much of the fear and mistrust of Clan Assamite. Predominantly practiced by proven ancillae and elders of the Clan, the Path of Blood leads these beings into direct conflict with non-Assamite vampires. Kindred on the Path of Blood gracefully attempt to convince other Kindred of their \u201cone true way\u201d, so a few individuals from other Clans also support this Path.<br>Practitioners of little understanding seek merely to follow the teachings of Haqim, doing so without question. However, those of greater wisdom seek to explore just what \u201cbecoming One\u201d entails. By taking the cursed blood of the Antediluvians and their spawn, the followers of the Path hope to concentrate the curse of Khayyin in the hands of those who will use it responsibly (namely, the Assamite Clan). In such a way, according to Path doctrine, can the great endgame of Gehenna be averted. Accordingly, Assamite Ancients practice rigorous purity and meditation, and rumors of a Golconda-like state among these beings have recently trickled into the larger Kindred community.\n\n# Followers\nStudy, proselytism, and selective strikes against the rest of the Kindred world occupy the nights of Kindred on this Path. Fanatical in their quest, the Assassins bring Final Death to those who would get in the way of collecting the blood payments or sending a portion of those payments back to their sires and leaders in Alamut. Mostly, however, Assamites seek to convert those of high Generation, as they are farther removed from their progenitors and, thus, the taint of evil.\n\n# Following\nThis Path espouses the liberal practice of Kindred murder and the acquisition of blood. More enlightened Kindred on the Path of Blood also seek to uncover lore and knowledge that may lead them to a key to remove the Tremere ritual that cripples them. As such, vampires who follow the Path of Blood are not mindless monsters murdering Kindred in the streets, but wouldbe saviors of the entire world. All Kindred on the Path of Blood strive to attain \u201cOneness\u201d with the mythical Haqim, though few who have reached this lofty goal deign to explain its nature. Most Dervishes believe that Oneness resembles Golconda, or another state wherein vampires can cast off their curse and revel in their Cainite natures.\n\n# Abilities\nCombat and occult Abilities aid followers in their pursuit of the Path\u2019s principles. Athletics, Brawl, Melee, Intimidation, and Occult are among the Abilities prized by Path of Blood supporters.\n\n# Preferred Disciplines\nThis Path lends itself to the refinement of Quietus, Obfuscate, and Celerity. Some followers cultivate knowledge of Thaumaturgy to aid them in their quests."

As part of this Background, the character\u2019s claim to the domain is recognized by the Prince or some other Kindred authority in the city where it is located. The Kindred who claims the domain can\u2019t keep the living inhabitants from going about their business, nor does she exercise any direct infuence over them, but she can keep watch herself and mind their comings and goings. She can also have Allies or Retainers specifically look for unfamiliar vampires and alert her when they find some. Domain refers specifically to the geography (in most cases a neighborhood or street) and properties on it, as opposed to the people who may dwell there (which is the emphasis of Herd). Domain plays an importantpart in Kindred society - vampires who lack significant Domain seldom earn respect - but it isn\u2019t an automatic entitlement to status among the Damned. You may designate one or more dots in Domain to increase the security of your character\u2019s territory rather than its size. Each dot so assigned to security provides a +1 difficulty penalty to efforts to intrude into the domain by anyone your character hasn\u2019t specifically allowed in, and a -1 difficulty bonus to efforts by your character to identify and track intruders in the domain. A Domain of one dot\u2019s size and two dots\u2019 security, for instance, is small but quite resistant to intrusion, as opposed to a Domain rating of three dots\u2019 size with no extraordinary security. Each level of Domain reduces the difficulty of hunting checks by one for your character and those whom the character allows in. It also adds to your starting (not maximum) blood pool. If you use the domain security option, each dot of domain security raises the difficulty of hunting checks by one for uninvited vampires. See p. 259 for more information on hunting. Domain (both size and security) can be used with pooled Background points."

A character\u2019s Willpower pool will likely fluctuate a great deal during the course of a story or chronicle. It decreases by one point every time a player uses a Willpower point to enable his character to do something extraordinary, like maintain self-control or gain an automatic success. Eventually, the character will have no Willpower left, and will no longer be able to exert the effort he once could. A character with no Willpower pool is exhausted mentally, physically,and spiritually, and will have great difficulty doing anything, as he can no longer muster the energy to undertake an action or cause. Willpower points can be regained during the course of a story, though players are advised to be frugal with their characters\u2019 Willpower pools.<br>The Willpower Trait is measured on a 1-10 scale rather than a 1-5 scale. At character creation, a character\u2019s Willpower is equal to his Courage Virtue.<br>More information on Willpower is available in Chapter Six, under \u201cSpending Willpower\u201d on p. 266."

As atavistic as Conviction, Instinct is the Virtue of a monster who accepts his nature rather than maintaining a sense of human compassion.<br>Instinct allows the character to harness the Beast\u2019s destructive power; a character with high Instinct is primal and turbulent. A player rolls Instinct when attempting to control a character\u2019s existing frenzy. When a character who possesses the Instinct Virtue faces frenzy, she always enters the frenzy, unless the difficulty to avoid it is less than her Instinct Trait, in which case she may choose whether or not to frenzy. Thereafter, for the duration of the frenzy, the character is wholly under the Beast\u2019s sway, and must be run by the player (or controlled by the Storyteller) in an appropriate fashion. Any time the player wishes the character to consciously take an action (known as \u201criding the wave\u201d), she must roll Instinct against the difficulty to avoid the frenzy.

The Assamites use their speed in conjunction with stealth to strike quickly and viciously from the shadows before they are noticed. Brujah, on the other hand, simply like the edge that the power gives them against overwhelming odds. The Toreador are more inclined to use Celerity to provide an air of unnatural grace to live performances or for an extra push to complete a masterpiece on time, but they can be as quick to draw blood as any assassin or punk when angered.\n\n_System:_ Each point of Celerity adds one die to every Dexterity-related dice roll. In addition, the player can spend one blood point to take an extra action up to the number of dots he has in Celerity at the beginning of the relevant turn; this expenditure can go beyond her normal Generation maximum. Any dots used for extra actions, however, are no longer available for Dexterity-related rolls during that turn. These additional actions must be physical (e.g., the vampire cannot use a mental Discipline like Dominate multiple times in one turn), and extra actions occur at the end of the turn (the vampire\u2019s regular action still takes place per her initiative roll).\n\nNormally, a character without Celerity must divide their dice if she wants to take multiple actions in a single turn, as per p. 248. A character using Celerity performs his extra actions (including full movement) without penalty, gaining a full dice pool for each separate action. Extra actions gained through Celerity may not in turn be split into multiple actions, however."

In the case of quills, the subject takes a number of health levels equal to five minus the number of successes (a botch kills the subject or sends the vampire into torpor). These health levels may be healed normally. Knuckle spikes inflict Strength +1 lethal damage. Defensive quills inflict a hand-to-hand attacker\u2019s Strength in lethal damage unless the attacker scores three or more successes on the attack roll (in which case the attacker takes no damage); the defender still takes damage normally.

The difficulty of the roll is 7 in either case. This is an extended action requiring as many total successes as the target has Willpower. Failure indicates that the player must start over from the beginning, while a botch indicates that the vampire may not affect that subject\u2019s Beast for the remainder of the scene. When a mortal\u2019s Beast is cowed or soothed, she can no longer use or regain Willpower. She ceases all struggles, whether mental or physical. She doesn\u2019t even defend herself if assaulted, though the Storyteller may allow a Willpower roll if the mortal believes her life is truly threatened. To recover from this power, the mortal\u2019s player rolls Willpower (difficulty 6) once per day until she accumulates enough successes to equal the vampire\u2019s ^Willpower^. Kindred cannot be affected by this power. Though a vampire\u2019s Beast cannot be cowed with this ability, the Storyteller may allow characters to use the \u201csoothing\u201d variation of this power to pull a vampire out of frenzy. With three or more successes, the frenzying vampire may roll again to pull herself out of frenzy, using the same difficulty as the stimulus that caused the frenzy originally."

A botch on the roll sends the vampire into an uncontrolled frenzy which Conquer the Beast may not be used to end. The player may also roll ^Willpower^ (difficulty 9) to enable the character to control an involuntary frenzy. In this case, a Willpower point must be spent for every turn that the vampire remains in frenzy. The player may make Self-Control/Instinct rolls as normal to end a frenzy, but if the vampire runs out of Willpower points before the frenzy ends, he drops into an uncontrolled frenzy again. A botch on the Willpower roll raises the difficulty of the vampire\u2019s Self-Control/Instinct rolls by two and renders Conquer the Beast unusable for the remainder of the night."

Some elders believe that since animals don\u2019t have souls but spirits, the vampire can move his own soul into the animal\u2019s body. Many younger vampires think it a matter of transferring one\u2019s consciousness into the animal\u2019s mind. In either case, it\u2019s agreed that the beast\u2019s weaker spirit (or mind) is pushed aside by the Kindred\u2019s own consciousness. The vampire\u2019s body falls into a motionless state akin to torpor while his mind takes control of the animal\u2019s actions, remaining this way until the Kindred\u2019s consciousness returns. Some haughty Tzimisce eschew this power, considering it debasing to enter the body of a lesser creature. When they do stoop to using it, they possess only predators. Conversely, Gangrel revel in connecting to the natural world in this way. They delight in sampling different animals\u2019 natures.\n_System_: The player rolls ^Manipulation + Animal Ken^ (difficulty 8) as the character looks into the animal\u2019s eyes (see sidebar on p.152). The number of successes allows the character to employ some mental Disciplines while possessing the animal, as noted below.\n<table><tr><th>Successes</th><th>Result</th></tr><tr><td>1 success</td><td>Cannot use Disciplines</td></tr><tr><td>2 successes</td><td>Can use Auspex and other sensory powers</td></tr><tr><td>3 successes</td><td>Can also use Presence and other powers of emotional manipulation</td></tr><tr><td>4 successes</td><td>Can also use Dementation, Dominate, and other powers of mental manipulation</td></tr><tr><td>5 successes</td><td>Can also use Chimerstry, Necromancy, Thaumaturgy, and other mystical powers</td></tr></table>This power entwines the character\u2019s consciousness closely with the animal\u2019s spirit, so much so that the character may continue to think and feel like that animal even after breaking the connection. This effect continues until the character spends a total of seven nights or three Willpower points to resist and finally overcome the animal nature. This should be role-played, though the character will be affected to a lesser degree if the player chooses to spend Willpower. At the end of any particularly exciting incident during possession, the player rolls ^Wits + Empathy^ (difficulty 8) for the character to retain his own mind. Failure indicates that the character\u2019s mind returns to his own body, but still thinks in purely animalistic terms. A botch returns the character to his body, and also sends him into frenzy. The character may travel as far from his own physical body as he chooses while possessing the animal. The character retains no conscious connection with his vampire body during this time, though. The vampire may also venture out during the day, albeit in the animal\u2019s body. However, the character\u2019s own body must be awake to do so, requiring a successful roll to remain awake (see p.262). If the character leaves the animal\u2019s body (by choice, if his body falls asleep, or after sustaining significant injury), the vampire\u2019s consciousness returns to his physical form instantaneously. Although the vampire has no conscious link to his body while possessing the animal, he does form a sympathetic bond. Anything the animal feels, the vampire also experiences, from pleasure to pain. In fact, any damage the animal\u2019s body sustains is also applied to the character\u2019s body, though the Kindred body may soak as normal. If the animal dies before the vampire\u2019s soul can flee from the body, the character\u2019s body falls into torpor. Presumably this is in sympathetic response to the massive trauma of death, but some Kindred believe that the vampire\u2019s soul is cast adrift during this time and must find its way back to the body."

                    "description": "This power is the basis from which all other Animalism abilities grow. The vampire creates an empathic connection with a beast, thereby allowing him to communicate or issue simple commands. The Kindred locks eyes with the animal, transmitting his desires through sheer force of will. Although it isn\u2019t necessary to actually \u201cspeak\u201d in chirps, hisses, or barks, some vampires find that doing so helps strengthen the connection with the animal. Eye contact must be maintained the entire time; if it\u2019s broken, the Kindred must re-establish contact to continue communication. The simpler the creature, the more difficult it becomes to connect with the animal\u2019s Beast. Mammals, predatory birds, and larger reptiles are relatively easy to communicate with. Insects, invertebrates, and most fish are just too simple to connect with.\nFeral Whispers provides no guarantees that an animal will want to deal with the vampire, nor does it ensure that the animal will pursue any requests the vampire makes of it. Still, it does at least make the creature better disposed toward the Kindred. The manner in which the vampire presents his desires to the animal often depends on the type of creature. A Kindred can often bully smaller beasts into heeding commands, but he\u2019s better off couching orders for large predators as requests.\nIf the vampire successfully uses the power, the animal performs the command to the best of its ability and intellect. Only the very brightest creatures understand truly complex directives (orders dealing with conditional situations or requiring abstract logic). Commands that the animal does understand remain deeply implanted, however, and guide its behavior for sometime.\n_System_: No roll is necessary to talk with an animal, but the character must establish eye contact (see p.152) first. Issuing commands requires a ^Manipulation + Animal Ken^ roll. The difficulty depends on the creature: Predatory mammals (wolves, cats, vampire bats) are difficulty 6, other mammals and predatory birds (rats, owls) are difficulty 7, and other birds and reptiles (pigeons, snakes) are difficulty 8. This difficulty is reduced by one if the character speaks to the animal in its \u201cnative tongue\u201d, and can be adjusted further by circumstances and roleplaying skill (we highly recommend that all communication between characters and animals be roleplayed).\nThe number of successes the player achieves dictates how strongly the character\u2019s command affects the animal. One success is sufficient to have a cat follow an individual and lead the character to the same location, three successes are enough to have a raven spy on a target for weeks, and five successes ensure that a grizzly ferociously guards the entrance to the character\u2019s wilderness haven for some months. The character\u2019s Nature plays a large part in how he approaches these conversations. The character might try intimidating, teasing, cajoling or rationalizing. The player should understand that he does not simply play his character in these situations, but the Beast Within as well. Using this power cannot force an animal to do something against its nature, or to force a creature to risk its life. While the aforementioned grizzly would stand guard to the vampire\u2019s haven and even fight for it, it would not do so against obviously superior numbers or something overwhelmingly supernatural. A predatory bird might be convinced to harry a target, but would definitely not hold ground. A docile dog or skittish cat would have no problem with reporting something it had seen, but it wouldn\u2019t enter combat unless given no other option - though it would likely agree to stand and fight and then flee at the first opportunity, if a harsh Kindred demanded it."

Especially weak-willed individuals wipe the memory of the Kindred from their minds. Although vampires are not shaken so easily, even Kindred may be momentarily surprised by a sudden vanishing.\n_System_: The player rolls ^Charisma + Stealth^; the difficulty equals the target\u2019s Wits + Alertness (use the highest total in the group if the character disappears in front of a crowd). With three or fewer successes, the character fades but does not vanish, becoming an indistinct, ghostlike figure. With more than three, he disappears completely. If the player scores more successes than an observer\u2019s Willpower rating, that person forgets that the vampire was there in the first place. Tracking the character accurately while he appears ghostlike requires a Perception + Alertness roll (difficulty 8). A successful roll means the individual can interact normally with the vampire (although the Kindred looks like a profoundly disturbing ghostly shape). A failed roll results in a +2 difficulty modifier (maximum 10) when attempting to act upon, or interact with, the vampire.

An Obfuscated vampire doesn\u2019t actually become invisible, however - rather, he is able to delude observers into believing that he has vanished. Obfuscate also allows Kindred to change their features and conceal other people or objects. Typically vampires using Obfuscate must be within a short range of their witnesses (approximately five yards or meters per dot of Wits + Stealth) for their power to be effective.\n\nUnless the Kindred chooses to make herself seen, she can remain obscured for as long as she wills it. At higher levels, the vampire can actually fade from sight so subtly that those nearby can\u2019t actually recall the moment at which she left.\n\nUsually, few mortals or supernaturals (even those trained in Awareness) can pierce through the fog of Obfuscate. Animals, who rely more on their instincts than their normal senses, can sometime perceive (and be frightened by) the vampire\u2019s presence. Children and those to whom deception is foreign may also be able to pierce the illusion, at the Storyteller\u2019s discretion. Finally, the Auspex Discipline enables Kindred to see through Obfuscate. Even that is not guaranteed, however; refer to \u201cSeeing the Unseen,\u201d p. 142, for more details. (Storytellers needing a die roll for animals or children can use this quick and dirty guideline: treat them as if they had Auspex 1 in terms of contesting Obfuscate. They do not have the Auspex 1 power, but are considered to have it when determining whether a vampire is noticed.)\n\nSince Obfuscate clouds the mind of the viewer, vampires can\u2019t use it to hide their presence from electronic or mechanical devices. Video and photo cameras, for example, capture the vampire\u2019s image accurately. Even so, the person using, say, her cell phone to record an Obfuscated vampire will still have her mind impacted by the power, and she won\u2019t see the Kindred\u2019s image until she views the video at a later date (if even then).\n\nSeveral Clans cultivate this power - the Assamites, Followers of Set, and Malkavians, for example - but the Nosferatu are particularly known for this Discipline. Some elder Kindred believe that Caine, or perhaps Lilith, bestowed the Clan with this Discipline to compensate for the hideous physical deformities its members suffer.\n\nMost Obfuscate powers last for a scene, or until the vampire ceases maintaining them. Once evoked, they require very little mental effort to keep in place."

The Sabbat has learned to its chagrin that if the Blood Brothers are not explicitly told to separate after using this power, they won\u2019t. This merger is, apparently, what the Blood Brothers truly want.\n_System_: Every vampire in the circle who wishes to become part of the Coagulated Entity spends three blood points. Three turns after the process begins, the monster is complete and able to act. The vampire of the lowest Generation who is part of the construct guides the creature\u2019s actions. The actual Generation of the creature itself, however, is the highest Generation of any vampire present in the construct, less one for each additional vampire present in the construct. (Using the previous example, the Eleventh-Generation vampire would be the guide but the highest Generation is 13, so the overall Entity would be 13 minus 2, or Eleventh Generation). The creature\u2019s Strength, Stamina, and Perception are equal to the guide\u2019s, with a +1 for every additional vampire contained within. (Generational limits do not apply to this creature - through sheer size, a Coagulated Entity may have a Strength of 7 or more). All physical actions undertaken by the monstrosity gain one extra die to the pool for each vampire beyond the first present in the construct (before splitting dice pools). Only one vampire in the circle needs to possess Sanguinus at Level Five for this power to work. Body parts tend to shift during the creation of a Coagulated Entity - fanged maws at the ends of hands and eyes atop fleshy stalks have been reported by terrified survivors. Storytellers should feel free to give any bonuses (or penalties) to the construct as they see fit. A Coagulated Entity may not be staked, as it has too many hearts in unconventional places for any but the blindest luck to impale. It has a vampire\u2019s normal seven health levels, plus two for each additional vampire who becomes part of the entity (treat these extra health levels as Bruised). The entity remains congealed for one scene, unless the Storyteller wishes to rule that no one told the Blood Brothers to separate."

The Gestalt power is that hive-mind, the ability of the Frankensteins to coordinate silently and perfectly in battle, to avoid mind-controlling powers, and to act in unison.\n_System_: This power confers several benefits on the Blood Brothers. For this power to work, however, every Blood Brother in the circle must spend a blood point. If even one member cannot or will not spend a blood point, this power fails. Once a Blood Brother has met the Final Death, he is no longer a part of the circle, so the power continues to function among the still-undead members of the group. Gestalt lasts for one scene. While this power is active:\nDominate, Presence, and the like take effect against the highest Willpower rating in the circle. For example, if a vampire attempts to Dominate a Blood Brother under the influence of Gestalt, she must roll against the highest Willpower rating any of the vampires in the circle possesses, even if her subject has the lowest Willpower rating in the circle. Additionally, a Blood Brother affected by powers in this manner drops out of the Gestalt, though Gestalt remains active for others. This mental \u201cfuse\u201d was supposedly created to prevent the entire circle from being Dominated by a vampire looking into the eyes of one Blood Brother.\nPerception difficulties for all Blood Brothers in the circle decrease by three, as they share the sensory input of other vampires in the circle.\nBy taking no action other than concentrating, a Blood Brother may \u201cloan\u201d an Ability to another brother. For example, a wounded vampire with Melee 4 may step out of combat and loan a circle-mate with Melee 2 his mastery of that Skill. The \u201cborrowing\u201d vampire makes Ability checks against the loaned Trait as if it were his own.\nThe Blood Brothers in the Gestalt may communicate through telepathy, allowing them to coordinate actions. In game terms, only one initiative roll is made for the circle, based on the character with the highest initiative rating (see p.271). Not all Blood Brothers in the circle need to have this level of Sanguinus to benefit from the Gestalt. If a given character does not know this power, though, the player rolls ^Wits + Occult^ (difficulty 7) when the power is enacted. If this roll fails, the character can still receive loaned Abilities, but gains no other benefits from the Gestalt."

The Frankensteins are not a group of vampires but are one vampire in several bodies, or so goes the theory. As such, any of their characteristics must be viewed as a continuum - they are not individually Twelfth, Eleventh, and Thirteenth Generation, for example, but they are collectively Ninth Generation at any given time. While the metaphysics of this kind of thinking makes most vampires\u2019 heads ache, there seems to be something to it. A Blood Brother can draw strength from his circle, lowering his Generation to allow for greater feats of vitae expenditure.\n_System_: Each member of the circle can \u201cdonate\u201d one step in Generation. In the example listed above, the vampire of Eleventh Generation could take one step from his two circle-mates and drop to Ninth, but the vampire of Thirteenth Generation couldn\u2019t drop lower than Eleventh. No matter how big the circle, no Blood Brother can drop to an effective Generation lower than Fourth. Likewise, a Thirteenth Generation Blood Brother can drop to an effective Generation of Fourteenth, which carries with it the penalties listed for the Fourteenth Generation Flaw (p.481) (He cannot go to Fifteenth Generation, however). As with Gestalt, only one Blood Brother needs to know this power in order to begin the process. Any that don\u2019t have Walk of Caine need to make a Stamina + Awareness roll (difficulty 7). If this roll fails, they may not participate in the action."

That spirit-shard can wrest spiritual energy out of those places of power and use it to aid the Lhiannan. A word of caution, however: stealing too much power from any mystical site renders it barren and lifeless, much as if the Cainite had consumed the very blood of the Earth. Also, wizards and werewolves frequent these same sites, and destroying these places can rouse their ire.\n_System_: The player rolls ^Perception + Occult^ (difficulty 8). One success determines if a given location is a suitable site (a decision generally left in the Storyteller\u2019s hands, though a Lhiannan with a high Domain Background may have such a site within her holdings). Two or more successes on this roll grants a rough idea of the site\u2019s power on a scale of 1 to 5. If the character wishes to tap the power of that location, she must spend a scene and one blood point marking various parts of the site with sigils of power, keys for her spirit-shard to unlock the location\u2019s energies. Once the site is prepared, the player makes a second, reflexive ^Perception + Occult^ roll (difficulty 7). Any successes beyond the site\u2019s power rating are ignored. For each success, the player gains two dice, which she may add to any dice pools (except those to avoid frenzy or R\u00f6tschreck) for the remainder of the scene. These dice are gone when used, but the character may tap the same location again from turn to turn. The player must make the ^Perception + Occult^ roll each time. Each \u201cdrink\u201d of the site\u2019s energies depletes it, however, as described below. The Lhiannan\u2019s spirit-shard is a greedy thing, wearing as it does the garb of a Cainite\u2019s Beast, and drinks the site\u2019s energies recklessly. A Lhiannan can only garner a number of successes equal to 10 times the site\u2019s power rating, after which point the area turns into a barren wasteland, incapable of sustaining life. This sort of activity in particular is certain to attract the attention of Lupines or wizards. A site may replenish itself over a period of years. However, a site that is tapped with Drink Dry the Earth at any point during the year is unable to replenish lost dice at all that year, and if the site is completely drained, it is irrevocably dead."

The curse takes effect the moment the victim sees his name scrawled in blood.\n_System_: The player spends three blood points. The Lhiannan must write the foe\u2019s name in blood, and it must be displayed on a part of her body visible to the intended target in order for Inscribe the Curse to take effect. The player chooses which curse to enact on the target from the list below; the curse takes effect as soon as the target sees his name. He does not need to understand the language used, but if he can comprehend it, he may resist the curse with a Wits + Occult roll (difficulty 8).

The foe becomes confused as parts of his mind become disconnected from one another; he must spend one Willpower point in order to attempt any Knowledge roll or use any magical ability or Discipline (other than Celerity, Fortitude, or Potence). This Willpower doesn\u2019t buy him a success on that roll; it simply allows him to make it.\n_Voice_: Inscribe the name on the throat. The victim loses the power of speech; he can grunt or moan, but cannot say any words.\n_Soul_: Inscribe the name down the sternum and over the heart. The subject loses his will to resist the Beast: difficulties to avoid frenzy are increased by two. Non-vampires are overcome by fear.

The character may choose to inscribe both the moon and the sun, but each symbol requires the blood expenditure and 15 minutes to trace it. She can also inscribe these sigils on any voluntary subject.

The internal effects of this razor-sharp honing of Protean, however, are in some ways more dramatic than any external manifestation. A vampire with this power can heighten the efficiency of his undead body\u2019s internal workings to levels undreamed of by lesser Kindred, withstanding inconceivable amounts of injury and moving with blinding speed and shattering strength.\n_System_: The player spends four blood points to activate this power and an additional two blood points for every turn past the first that Inward Focus is maintained. There are three effects of this power: First, the character gains a number of extra actions during each turn equal to his unmodified Dexterity score. Second, the damage of his physical attacks is increased by three dice per dice pool. Finally, all damage inflicted on the character is halved and rounded down after the soak roll is made (so an attack that inflicts five health levels after soak is reduced to two health levels). This power may be used in conjunction with other Protean powers that modify the character\u2019s combat abilities, such as Shape of the Beast\u2019s Wrath (above). It may also be used in conjunction with Celerity, Fortitude, and Potence, turning a vampire who has mastered this power into a truly terrifying opponent."

He foats at a brisk pace and may slip under doors, through screens, down pipes, and through other tiny openings. Although strong winds can blow the vampire from his chosen course, even hurricane-force winds cannot disperse his mist shape.

Strong winds may buffet the character, although Disciplines such as Potence may be used to resist them. Vampires in Mist Form can perceive their surroundings normally, although they cannot use powers that require eye contact. The vampire is immune to all mundane physical attacks while in mist form, although supernatural attacks affect him normally. Also, the vampire takes one fewer die of damage from fire and sunlight.

The immortal literally sinks into the bare ground, transmuting his substance to bond with the earth. Though a vampire can immerse himself fully into the ground, he cannot move around within it. Further, it is impossible to meld into earth through another substance. Wood slats, blacktop, even artificial turf blocks Earth Meld\u2019s effectiveness - then again, it\u2019s a relatively simple matter for a vampire at this level of power to grow claws and rip apart enough of the fooring to expose the raw soil beneath. By interring himself in the ground, the vampire gains full protection from daylight when outdoors. It is also the method of choice for those Kindred who wish to sleep away the centuries; these vampires lock themselves in the earth\u2019s embrace, gaining strength and power as they rest. Superstitious and paranoid Kindred whisper that thousands of Ancients sleep within theground and will awaken when Gehenna arrives. While so interred, the vampire is in a transitional state between flesh and earth. His physical presence exists between the physical world and the astral plane. As such, the vampire is difficult to sense, even through supernatural means. However, a disruption to the soil that the immortal occupies, or to his presence on the astral realm, returns him immediately to the physical world (and to full wakefulness), showering dirt outward as his body displaces the soil.\n_System_: No roll is necessary, although the character must spend a blood point. Sinking into the earth is automatic and takes a turn to complete. The character falls into a state one step above torpor during this time, sensing his surroundings only distantly. The player must make a ^Humanity or Path^ roll (difficulty 6) for the character to rouse himself in response to danger prior to his desired time of emergence. Since the character is in an inbetween state, any attempts to locate him (catching his scent, scanning for his aura, traveling astrally, and so on) are made at +2 difficulty. Astral individuals cannot affect the vampire directly, instead meeting with a kind of spongy resistance as their hands pass through him. Similarly, digging in the material world encounters incredibly hard-packed earth, virtually as dense as stone. Attempts at violence upon the submerged vampire from either side return him to his physical nature, expelling the soil with which he bonded in a blinding spray (all Perception-based rolls are at +2 difficulty for the turn). The character himself subtracts two from his initiative for the first turn after his restoration, due to momentary disorientation. Once expelled from the earth, the vampire may act normally."

A vampire employing this power shifts into a huge, monstrous form, gaining half her height again and tripling her weight. Her overall shape flows into an unholy amalgamation of her own form and that of the animal she feels the closest kinship to (wolves, rats, and great cats are the most common manifestations, though ravens, serpents, bats, and stranger beasts have been reported). The vampire\u2019s new shape does bear some vague resemblance to the war-forms of the werecreatures, but the difference quickly becomes apparent.\n_System_: The player spends three blood points, the expenditure of which triggers the change. The character\u2019s transformation takes three turns (the player may spend additional blood points to reduce this time at a cost of one point per turn of reduction). Once transformed, the character remains in this form until sunrise or until she shifts back voluntarily. The precise Traits of this form are determined when the character first learns this power, as is the animal whose appearance the character takes on. The vampire\u2019s new form adds a total of seven dots to the character\u2019s Physical Attributes. At least one dot must go into each Physical Attribute, meaning that no more than five can go into any one (so a character could have +5 Strength, +1 Dexterity, and +1 Stamina, but not +2 Strength and +5 Dexterity). These bonuses are always the same once they are selected; a different allocation requires that the character buy this power a second time and thus purchase another alternate form. Additionally, the character inflicts Strength + 2 dice of aggravated damage with both bite and claw attacks when in monstrous form. She also gains an extra Hurt health level, and doubles her normal running speed. Finally, the character\u2019s perceptions are also heightened. She is assumed to have both the Auspex power Heightened Senses and the Protean power Eyes of the Beast after transformation, with all of the benefits and drawbacks of each. This form does carry two additional drawbacks. The first is a lack of communication ability. The character\u2019s Social Attributes all drop to 1, or to 0 if they already were 1 (except when making Intimidation rolls) when the transformation occurs. The second problem that a character in this form encounters is the suddenly heightened power of her Beast. All difficulties of rolls to resist frenzy are increased by two for the duration of the power\u2019s effect, and the player may not spend Willpower points on such rolls."

Although his lungs are no longer solid, the vampire can still speak, a fact in which some elders of the Daughters of Cacophony bloodline have expressed great interest.\n_System_: The player spends three blood points. The transformation takes one turn to complete, and lasts for the rest of the night unless the character decides to reverse it. When the power takes hold, the character becomes completely insubstantial, but remains fully visible. Henceforth, he is unaffected by any physical attacks, and he doubles his dice pool to soak damage from fire and sunlight.

The schism comes because the power allows the elder who possesses it to temporarily return his appearance to what it was before the Embrace, removing the bestial features he has accumulated over the centuries. Restore the Mortal Visage has only been displayed by Gangrel; several Nosferatu elders have attempted to develop it, and it is whispered that they met spontaneous, grotesque Final Deaths when they attempted to take their mortal forms.\n_System_: The player spends three blood points and a Willpower point and rolls ^Willpower^ (difficulty 8). Success restores the character\u2019s appearance to what it was just before he was first Embraced, erasing all physical or social animalistic features gained from frenzies (see p.55). The power also affects any of the character\u2019s affected Traits relating to social interaction, returning them to their original values (for example, lost Appearance dots return, but Humanity points removed due to frenzy are not).

Gangrel are reputed to change to other animal forms better suited to their environment - jackals in Africa, dholes in Asia, and even enormous rats in urban environments - a feat that other Clans learning Protean cannot seem to duplicate.\n_System_: The character spends one blood point to assume the desired shape.

While in the animal\u2019s shape, the vampire can use any Discipline he possesses except Necromancy, Serpentis, Thaumaturgy, or Vicissitude (as well as any others the Storyteller deems unavailable). Furthermore, each form gives the character the abilities of that creature. In wolf form, the vampire\u2019s teeth and claws inflict Strength + 1 aggravated damage, he can run at double speed, and the difficulties of all Perception rolls are reduced by two. In bat form, the vampire\u2019s Strength is reduced to 1, but he can fy at speeds of up to 20 miles per hour, difficulties for all hearing-based Perception rolls are reduced by three, and attacks made against him are at +2 difficulty due to his small size.

Ventrue who voice this opinion too loudly also tend to have numerous chances to test just how effective Cooperation is.\n_System_: To invoke Cooperation, the player spends a blood point and rolls ^Charisma + Leadership^ (difficulty 8). The number of individuals affected is determined by how many successes the player rolls. Cooperation lasts for the remainder of the scene in which it is invoked, though particularly strong users of Presence may create longer-lasting feelings of non-aggression (at Storyteller discretion) by spending Willpower. While this poweris in effect, all those under its infuence are more favorably disposed toward one another and are more willing to extend trust or make cooperative plans. For the most part, players should simply roleplay Co-operation\u2019s effects, but there are some concrete ramifications to the power\u2019s use. For example, Self-Control/Instinct difficulties to resist frenzy in response to insults from within the target group are decreased by three, and certain Social Flaws may be decreased in impact for the duration of Cooperation.\n<table><tr><th>Successes</th><th>Result</th></tr><tr><td>1 success</td><td>Two people</td></tr><tr><td>2 successes</td><td>Four people</td></tr><tr><td>3 successes</td><td>Eight people</td></tr><tr><td>4 successes</td><td>20 people</td></tr><tr><td>5 successes</td><td>Everyone in the character\u2019s immediate vicinity</td></tr></table>"

After all, he\u2019s coming to the vampire herself, not to some predetermined site. Although this power allows the vampire to call someone across a staggering distance, it is most useful when used locally.

Obviously, the individual\u2019s financial resources are a factor; if he doesn\u2019t have the money to travel quickly, it will take him a far greater time to get there. The subject thinks mainly of reaching the vampire, but does not neglect his own well-being. This is less of a consideration if he only has to cross a room, unless he must get through a gang of gun-wielding punks to do so. The individual retains his survival instincts, and while he won\u2019t shirk physical violence to reach the vampire\u2019s side, he won\u2019t subject himself to suicidal situations. The Summoning dissipates at dawn. Unless the subject is trained to continue toward the vampire after the first call, the immortal must Summon each night until the target arrives.

Vampires three or more Generations lower than the wielder need only spend a single Willpower to ignore the Presence for an entire night and need not roll Willpower to do so.\n\nThe major drawback of Presence is that it controls only the emotions. It causes others to feel a certain way toward the vampire, but does not give her outright control over them. While people weigh strongly the orders that the vampire declares, their minds are still their own. Suicidal or ridiculous directives don\u2019t sound any more sensible just because the person giving them is unusually fascinating. Still, inspired eloquence or significant wealth used in combination with this Discipline can enable the vampire to urge others along a desired course.\n\nThe Brujah, Followers of Set, Toreador, and Ventrue Clans are all adept in this Discipline.

It\u2019s similar to Thaumaturgy in that it has several \u201cpaths\u201d and accompanying \u201crituals\u201d rather than a strict linear progression of powers. The study of Necromancy is not widespread among the Kindred, and its practitioners - primarily the Giovanni - are shunned and despised for their foul practices (until those practices become useful, of course).\n\nOver the centuries, the various schools of vampiric Necromancy have evolved and diversified from an earlier form of death magic, leaving several distinct paths of necromantic magic available to Cainites. Nearly all modern necromancers learn the Sepulchre Path first before extending their studies to other paths. The primary Necromancy path increases automatically as the character increases her overall Necromancy rating. Other paths must be bought separately, using the experience costs for secondary paths.\n\nLike Thaumaturgy, Necromancy has also spawned a series of rituals. While not nearly so immediate in effect as the basic powers of Necromancy, Necromantic rituals can have impressive long-term effects. Unsurprisingly, the elements of Necromantic ritual are things like long-buried corpses and hands from the cadavers of hanged men, so obtaining suitable materials can be quite difficult.\n\n_System:_ A Cainite necromancer must learn at least three levels in his primary path before learning his first level in a secondary Necromancy path. He must then master the primary path (all five levels) before acquiring any knowledge of a third path.\n\nAs with Thaumaturgy, advancement in the primary path costs the normal experience amount, while study of additional Necromantic paths incurs an additional experience-point cost (see p. 124). Because Necromancy is not quite so rigid a study as Thaumaturgy is, the rolls required to use Necromantic powers can vary from path to path and even within individual paths. The commonly-learned Sepulchre Path is presented first, with the remaining paths presented in alphabetical order. Statistics for ghosts may be found in Chapter Nine, p. 385."

The number of successes determines how well the suggestion takes hold in the victim\u2019s subconscious.

At three or four successes, the command is effective unless following it endangers the subject. At five successes or greater, the vampire can implant nearly any sort of command. No matter how strong the Kindred\u2019s will, his command cannot force the subject to harm herself directly or defy her innate Nature. So, while a vampire who scored five successes could make a 98-pound weakling attack a 300-pound bouncer, he could not make the mortal shoot herself in the head. If a vampire tries to Mesmerize a subject before the target fulfills a previously implanted directive, compare the successes rolled to those gained during the implanting of the first suggestion. Whichever roll had the greater number of successes is the command that now governs in the target\u2019s behavior; the other suggestion is wiped clean.

Once the Kindred overwhelms the subject\u2019s mind, the vampire moves his consciousness into the victim\u2019s body and controls it as easily as he uses his own. The mortal falls into a mental fugue while under possession. She is aware of events only in a distorted, dreamlike fashion. In turn, the vampire\u2019s mind focuses entirely on controlling his mortal subject. His own body lies in a torpid state, defenseless against any actions made toward it. Vampires cannot possess one another in this fashion, as even the weakest Kindred\u2019s mind is strong enough to resist such straightforward mental dominance. Only through a blood bond can one vampire control another to this degree. Supernatural creatures also cannot be possessed in this way, although ghouls that have drunk from the vampire using Possession can.\n_System_: The vampire must completely strip away the target\u2019s Willpower prior to possessing her. The player spends a Willpower point, then rolls ^Charisma + Intimidation^, while the subject rolls his Willpower in a resisted action (difficulty 7 for each).

Only if the attacker botches can the subject escape her fate, since this makes the target immune to any further Dominate attempts by that vampire for the rest of the story. Once the target loses all her temporary Willpower, her mind is open. The vampire rolls ^Manipulation + Intimidation^ (difficulty 7) to determine how fully he assumes control of the mortal shell. Similar to the Animalism power Subsume the Spirit, multiple successes allow the character to utilize some mental Disciplines, noted on the chart below.

The vampire may also venture out during the day in the mortal form. However, the vampire\u2019s own body must be awake to do so, requiring a successful roll to remain awake (see p.262). If the vampire leaves the mortal shell (by choice, if his body falls asleep, through supernatural expulsion, after sustaining significant injury, etc.), his consciousness returns to his physical form in an instant.\nOnce freed from possession, the mortal regains mental control of herself. This can happen in an instant, or the victim may lie comatose for days while her psyche copes with the violation.\nThe vampire experiences everything the mortal body feels during possession, from pleasure to pain. In fact, any damage the victim\u2019s body sustains is also applied to the character\u2019s body (though the Kindred may soak as normal). If the mortal dies before the vampire\u2019s soul can flee from the body, the character\u2019s body falls into torpor. Presumably this is in sympathetic response to the massive trauma of death, though some Kindred believe that the vampire\u2019s soul is cast adrift during this time and must find its way back to the body.\nThe Kindred can remain in the mortal\u2019s body even if his own torpid form is destroyed, though such a pathetic creature is not likely to exist for long. At each sunrise, the vampire must roll Courage (difficulty 8) or be expelled from the body. If forced from the mortal body, the vampire tumbles into the astral plane, his soul permanently lost in the spirit world. A vampire trapped in a mortal body may not be \u201cre-Embraced\u201d.

The degree of memory alteration depends on what the vampire desires. He may alter the subject\u2019s mind only slightly (quite effective for eliminating memories of the victim meeting or even being fed upon by the vampire) or utterly undo the victim\u2019s memories of her past. The degree of detail used has a direct bearing on how strongly the new memories take hold, since the victim\u2019s subconscious mind resists the alteration. A simplistic or incomplete false memory (\u201cYou went to the movies last night\u201d) crumbles much more quickly than does one with more attention to detail (\u201cYou thought about texting your girlfriend while you were in line at the new movie theater, but you knew you\u2019d have to turn your phone off once you got inside. You liked the movie well enough, but the plot seemed weak.

It\u2019s a relatively simple matter to rife through a victim\u2019s psyche and rip out the memories of the previous night without knowing what the subject did that evening. Doing so leaves a gap in the victim\u2019s mind, however - a hole that can give rise to further problems down the road. The Kindred may describe new memories, but these recollections seldom have the same degree of realism that the subject\u2019s original thoughts held. As such, this power isn\u2019t always completely effective. The victim may remember being bitten, but believe it to be an animal attack. Greater memories may return in pieces as dreams, or through sensory triggers like a familiar odor or spoken phrase. Even so, months or years may pass before the subject regains enough of her lost memories to make sense of the fragments. A vampire can also sense when a subject\u2019s memories were altered through use of this power, and even restore them, as a hypnotist draws forth suppressed thoughts.\n_System_: The player states what sorts of alteration he wants to perform, then rolls ^Wits + Subterfuge^ (difficulty equal to the target\u2019s current Willpower points).

The table below indicates the degree of modification possible to the subject\u2019s memory.

Over time, the victim becomes increasingly susceptible to the vampire\u2019s infuence while simultaneously growing more resistant to the corrupting efforts of other Kindred. Gaining complete control over a subject\u2019s mind is no small task, taking weeks or even months to accomplish. Kindred often fill their retainers\u2019 heads with subtle whispers and veiled urges, thereby ensuring these mortals\u2019 loyalty. Yet vampires must pay a high price for the minds they ensnare. Servants Dominated in this way lose much of their passion and individuality. They follow the vampire\u2019s orders quite literally, seldom taking initiative or showing any imagination. In the end, such retainers become like automatons or the walking dead.\n_System_: The player rolls ^Charisma + Leadership^ (difficulty equal to the target\u2019s current Willpower points) once per scene. Conditioning is an extended action, for which the Storyteller secretly determines the number of successes required. It typically requires between five and 10 times the subject\u2019s Self-Control/Instinct rating. Targets with more empathic Natures may require a lower number of successes, while those with willful Natures require a higher total. Only through roleplaying may a character discern whether his subject is conditioned successfully.\nA target may become more tractable even before becoming fully conditioned. Once the vampire accumulates half the required number of successes, the Storyteller may apply a lower difficulty to the vampire\u2019s subsequent uses of Dominate. After being conditioned, the target falls so far under the vampire\u2019s infuence that the Kindred need not make eye contact or even be present to retain absolute control. The subject does exactly as she is told (including taking actions that would injure herself), as long as her master can communicate with her verbally. No command roll is necessary unless the subject is totally isolated from the vampire\u2019s presence (in a different room, over the phone). Even if a command roll fails, the target will still likely carry out part of the orders given, simply because her master wishes it.\nAfter the subject is fully conditioned, other Kindred find her more difficult to Dominate. Such conditioning raises others\u2019 difficulties by two (to a maximum of 10). It is possible, though difficult, to shake Conditioning. The subject must be separated entirely from the vampire to whom she was in thrall. This period of separation varies depending on the individual, but the Storyteller may set it at six months, less a number of weeks equal to the subject\u2019s permanent Willpower rating (so a person with 5 Willpower must stay away from the vampire for just under five months). The subject regains her personality slowly during this time, though she may still lapse into brief spells of listlessness, despair, or even anger. If the vampire encounters the target before that time passes, a single successful ^Charisma + Leadership^ roll (difficulty of the target\u2019s current Willpower points) on the part of the vampire completely reasserts the dominance. If the subject makes it through the time period without intervention by her master, the target regains her former individuality. Even so, the vampire may reestablish conditioning more easily than the first time, since the subject is now predisposed to falling under the Kindred\u2019s mental control. New attempts require half the total number of successes than the last bout of conditioning did (which means the subject reaches the threshold for reduced difficulties sooner, as well)."

            "description": "Dominate is one of the most dreaded of Disciplines. It is a vampire\u2019s ability to influence another person\u2019s thoughts and actions through her own force of will. Dominate requires that the vampire capture her victim\u2019s gaze (see p. 152); as such, it may be used against only one subject at a time. Further, commands must be issued verbally, although simple orders may be made with signs - for example, a pointed finger and forceful expression to indicate \u201cGo!\u201d However, the subject won\u2019t comply if he can\u2019t understand the vampire, no matter how powerful the Kindred\u2019s will is.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, vampires to which Dominate comes naturally tend to be from willful, domineering Clans. The Giovanni, Lasombra, Tremere, and Ventrue all consider an iron will to be a boon, and are eager to impose that iron will on any who would move against them.\n\n\n\n_Eye Contact_\nMany myths and stories exist about a vampire\u2019s mystical ability to put people under her spell by looking deeply into her victim\u2019s eyes. The persistence of such stories through the ages isn\u2019t surprising, since a number of Kindred Disciplines powers (most notably Dominate) require eye contact in order to work. Other vampires, learning of this requirement, have attempted everything from wearing mirrored sunglasses to gouging out their own eyes in order to prevent an elder from exerting his will upon them.\n<p.But Kindred are not so easily thwarted. The need for eye contact stems from the aggressor Kindred\u2019s need to see his victim\u2019s soul, and the eyes are the traditionally known as the windows to the soul. While the vampire needs to capture his target\u2019s attention, the target\u2019s eyes need not be present for such a power to work (although the arts of the Tzimisce make this somewhat challenging at times) - they only need to find the soul of his victim laid bare.\n\nA target trying to avoid eye contact can make a Willpower roll against a difficulty equal to Dominate user\u2019s Manipulation + Intimidation (or other appropriate combination for other Disciplines or specific situations, at the Storyteller\u2019s discretion). The difficulty may be reduced for mitigating factors: -1 in the case of the target obscuring his eyes slightly (such as closing her eyes or wearing dark sunglasses) up to a -3 for the eyes being completely unseen (such as with a thick blindfold or having her eyes torn out). Ultimately, however, it is up to the Storyteller to decide whether eye contact is established in a particular case."

The more remote and free from violence the location is, the lower the difficulty. A cave far from human populations that has never seen violence might be difficulty 5, whereas the site of a grisly murder-suicide in a downtown area would be difficulty 9. The player spends a Willpower point and rolls ^Willpower^. Success creates the Pillar, which does not require a physical pillar - the Pillar of Osiris is conceptual, not literal. Once the Pillar is created, any vampire with at least one dot of Bardo receives a -3 to the difficulties of any Discipline or other mystical activity (including blood magic) performed at the Pillar. However, this requires regular trips to the Pillar. Once the vampire has created a Pillar, he must visit it at least once a month, or it ceases to function. In addition, for every week he is away from a Pillar (not necessarily the one he created), the difficulties of all rolls to avoid frenzy increase by one. The Beast, long denied by the Child\u2019s ascetic practices, grows in strength while away from the Pillar, and eventually pushes the vampire to frenzy and (likely) Humanity loss.

This long ritual allows a vampire to be put into torpor for as long as the Child wishes. The target can attempt to struggle free, but only once per century. Once the vampire is mummified, the Children usually seal her up in a deep tomb, where (hopefully) she will remain undisturbed.\n_System_: The target must be immobilized, ritually bound in strips of fabric, and prepared with incense and special herbs. The player then rolls ^Willpower^ in a contested action against the target\u2019s Willpower (both difficulty 8). If the Child wins, the target enters torpor. If the victim wins, he remains awake and the ritual cannot be completed for another night (meaning that resistance is usually temporary).

This creates a bolt of black flame that inflicts one die of aggravated damage; more blood points may be spent to increase the size and damage of the flame. Such fires are fleeting and dissipate at the end of the turn, unless the Baali continues to spend blood points on Conflagration over several turns, gradually creating a larger flame.

Storytellers should feel free to alter these guidelines based on the power level of the troupe and the form the Herald takes.

Although there are whispers of the existence of Tremere <i>antitribu</i> in the Sabbat, other Clans in the Sword of Caine have also researched and developed access to such mystical might. Nevertheless, the Tremere of the Camarilla remain this Discipline\u2019s masters.\n\nLike Necromancy, the practice of Thaumaturgy is divided into paths and rituals. Thaumaturgical paths are applications of the vampire\u2019s knowledge of blood magic, allowing her to create effects on a whim. Rituals are more formulaic in nature, most akin to ancient magical \u201cspells.\u201d Because so many different paths and rituals are available to the arcane Tremere, one never knows what to expect when confronted with a practitioner of this Discipline.\n\nWhen a character first learns Thaumaturgy, the player selects a path for the character. That path is considered the character\u2019s primary path, and she automatically receives one dot in it, as well as one Level One ritual. Thereafter, whenever the character increases her level in Thaumaturgy, her rating in the primary path increases by one as well. Additional rituals are learned separately, as part of a story; players need not pay experience points for their characters to learn rituals up to the level equal to their overall rating in Thaumaturgy, though they must find someone to teach the rituals in question. Path ratings never exceed 5, though the overall Thaumaturgy score may. If a character reaches a rating of 5 in her primary path and increases her Thaumaturgy score afterward, she may allocate her \u201cfree\u201d path dot to a different path. (Experience costs are covered on p. 124.)\n\nMany Kindred fear crossing the practitioners of Thaumaturgy. It is a very potent and mutable Discipline, and almost anything the Kindred wishes may be accomplished through its magic."

The colors change in sympathy with the subject\u2019s emotional state, blending into new tones in a constantly dancing pattern. The stronger the emotions involved, the more intense the hues become. A skilled vampire can learn much from her subject by reading the nuances of color and brilliance in the aura\u2019s flow. Aside from perceiving emotional states, vampires use Aura Perception to detect supernatural beings. The colors in Kindred auras, while intense, are quite pale; mage halos often flare and crackle with arcane power; the race of shapeshifters has strikingly bright, almost frantic, auras; ghosts have weak auras that ficker fitfully like a dying flame; and faerie creatures\u2019 radiance is shot through with capricious rainbow hues.\n_System_: After the character stares at the subject for at least a few seconds, the player rolls ^Perception + Empathy^ (difficulty 8); each success indicates how much of the subject\u2019s aura the character sees and understands (see the table below). A failure indicates that the play of colors and patterns yields no prevailing impression. A botch indicates a false or erroneous interpretation.

Note that it is nearly impossible to determine with certainty if a particular character is lying or not with this power - vampires are inherently deceitful by nature, but even mortals might react with anxiety to questions while still being truthful. It is, however, helpful in determine the target\u2019s emotional state, which might lead the vampire to decide that a particular target is suspicious. A character may choose to perform a very cursory aura scan of a large area like a nightclub\u2019s dance floor or the audience in a gallery. In this case, the player decides which characteristic of auras she\u2019s looking for, and that\u2019s the only information she\u2019s able to glean if the roll is successful. (At the Storyteller\u2019s discretion, on this general scan roll, more successes on the roll may more quickly yield what the character seeks). For example, the player may specify, \u201cWho\u2019s the most nervous person in attendance?\u201d or \u201cAre there any vampirically pale auras among the CEO\u2019s entourage?\u201d Thereafter, the player may narrow down her scrutiny of a single individual, with an additional roll as normal. The character may focus in on a particular subject\u2019s aura only once per scene with any degree of clarity. Any subsequent attempts that result in failure should be considered botches. It is very easy for the character to imagine seeing what she wants to see when judging someone\u2019s intentions. After 24 hours, the character may try again at no penalty. It is possible, though difficult, to sense the aura of a being who is otherwise invisible to normal sight. Refer to \u201cSeeing the Unseen\u201d, p.142, for more information."

The vampire\u2019s astral form is immune to physical damage or fatigue, and can \u201cfly\u201d with blinding speed anywhere across the earth - or even underground - so long as she remains below the moon\u2019s orbit.\nThe Kindred\u2019s material form lies in a torpid state while her astral self is active, and the vampire isn\u2019t aware of anything that befalls her body until she returns to it. An ephemeral silver cord connects the Kindred\u2019s psyche to her body. If this cord is severed, her consciousness becomes stranded in the astral plane (the realm of ghosts, spirits and shades). Attempting to return to the vampire\u2019s physical shell is a long and terrifying ordeal, especially since there is no guarantee that she will accomplish the journey successfully. This significant danger keeps many Kindred from leaving their bodies for long, but those who dare can learn much.\n_System_: Journeying in astral form requires the player to expend a point of Willpower and make a ^Perception + Awareness^ roll. Difficulty varies depending on the distance and complexity of the intended trip; 5 is within sight, 7 is nearby or to a familiar location, and 9 reflects a trip far from familiar territory (a first journey from North America to the Far East; trying to shortcut through the earth). The greater the number of successes rolled, the more focused the character\u2019s astral presence is and the easier it is for her to reach her desired destination.\nFailure means the character is unable to separate her consciousness from her body, while a botch can have nasty consequences - flinging her astral form to a random destination on Earth or in the spirit realm, arriving in a place where the sun is active (necessitating a frenzy roll, although the sunlight doesn\u2019t do any damage), or hurtling toward the desired destination so forcefully that the silver cord snaps.\nThe player may spend a point of Willpower to activate this power, and an additional point of Willpower to gain the success necessary to perform the jaunt. This is an exception to the normal rule where a player may not spend more than a single point of Willpower per turn.\nEach scene in Psychic Projection requires another point of Willpower and a new roll. Failure indicates that the vampire has lost her way and must retrace the path of her silver cord. A botch at this stage means the cord snaps, stranding the character\u2019s psychic form in the mysterious astral plane. An astral form may travel at great speeds (the Storyteller can use roughly 1000 miles per hour or 1500 kilometers per hour as a general guide) and carries no clothing or material objects of any kind. Some artifacts are said to exist in the spirit world, and the character can try to use one of these tools if she finds one. The character cannot bring such relics to the physical world when she returns to her body, however. Interaction with the physical world is impossible while using Psychic Projection. At best, the character may spend a Willpower point to manifest as a ghost-like shape. This apparition lasts one turn before fading away; while she can\u2019t affect anything physically during this time, the character can speak. Despite lacking physical substance, an astral character can use Auspex normally. At the Storyteller\u2019s discretion, such a character may employ some or all Animalism, Dementation, Dominate, Necromancy, Obtenebration, Presence, Thaumaturgy, and similar non-corporeal powers she has, though this typically requires a minimum of three successes on the initial Psychic Projection roll. If two astral shapes encounter one another, they interact as if they were solid. They may talk, touch,and even fight as if both were in the material world. Since they have no physical bodies, astral characters seeking to interact \u201cphysically\u201d substitute Mental and Social Traits for Physical ones (Wits replaces Dexterity, Manipulation supplants Strength, and Intelligence replaces Stamina). Due to the lack of a material form, the only real way to damage another psychic entity is to cut its silver cord. When fighting this way, consider Willpower points to be health levels; when a combatant loses all of her Willpower, the cord is severed. Although an astrally projected character remains in the reflection of the mortal world, she may venture further into the spirit realms, especially if she becomes lost. Other beings with particular sensitivity to psychic activity, such as ghosts, werewolves, and even some magi, travel the astral plane as well, and can interact with a vampire\u2019s psychic presence normally (although the astrally projected character is not considered a \u201cghost\u201d for powers such as Necromancy). The observing character notices the astrally projecting vampire with a Perception + Awareness roll (difficulty 8), requiring more successes than the Psychic Projection activation roll. Even those who do notice you won\u2019t be able to identify you; you are merely an immaterial shade hovering in the general area. Storytellers are encouraged to make trips into the spirit world as bizarre, mysterious and dream-like as possible. The world beyond is a vivid and fantastic place, where the true nature of things is stronger and often strikingly different from their earthly appearances."

The greater the individual\u2019s emotional connection to the object, the stronger the impression he leaves on it - and the more information the Kindred can glean from it.

This is one of the most potent vampiric abilities, since, given time, a Kindred can learn virtually anything from a subject without him ever knowing. The Tremere and Tzimisce in particular find this power especially useful in gleaning secrets from others, or for directing their mortal followers with silent precision.\n_System_: The player rolls ^Intelligence + Subterfuge^ (difficulty of the subject\u2019s current Willpower points). Projecting thoughts into the target\u2019s mind requires one success. The subject recognizes that the thoughts come from somewhere other than his own consciousness, though he cannot discern their actual origin without a successful Perception + Awareness roll (difficulty equalto the vampire\u2019s ^Manipulation + Subterfuge^). To read minds, one success must be rolled for each item of information plucked or each layer of thought pierced. Deep secrets or buried memories are harder to obtain than surface emotions or unspoken comments, requiring five or more successes to access. Reading thoughts with Telepathy does not commonly work upon the undead mind. A character may expend a Willpower point to make the effort, making the roll normally afterward. Likewise, it is equally difficult to read the thoughts of other supernatural creatures. However, the character may project her thoughts without expending a Willpower point. These thoughts, however, are still obviously intrusions into the target\u2019s mind, but the character may attempt to disguise her mental \u201cvoice\u201d with a roll of ^Manipulation + Subterfuge^ (difficulty equals the target\u2019s Perception + Awareness) so the target doesn\u2019t recognize her as the \u201cspeaker\u201d. Storytellers are encouraged to describe thoughts as flowing streams of impressions and images, rather than as a sequence of prose (powers such as Telepathic Communication are of more use for that). Instead of making flat statements like \u201cHe\u2019s planning on killing his former lover\u2019s new boyfriend\u201d, say \u201cYou see a fleeting series of visions: A couple kissing passionately in a doorway, then the man walking alone at night; you suddenly see your hands, knuckles white, wrapped around a steering wheel, with a figure crossing the street ahead; your heart, mortal now and hammering with panic as you hear the engine rev wildly; and above all, a blazing anger coupled with emotional agony and a panicked fear of loss\u201d.

While her senses of taste and touch extend no farther than normal, they likewise become far more distinct; the vampire could taste the hint of liquor in a victim\u2019s blood or feel the give of the board concealing a hollow space in the foor. The Kindred may magnify her senses at will, sustaining this heightened focus for as long as she desires. At the Storyteller\u2019s option, this may make hunting easier. Occasionally, this talent provides extrasensory or even precognitive insights. These brief, unfocused glimpses may be odd premonitions, flashes of empathy, or eerie feelings of foreboding. The vampire has no control over these perceptions, but with practice can learn to interpret them with a fair degree of accuracy. Expanded senses come at a price, however. Bright lights, loud noises and strong smells present a hazard while the vampire uses this power. In addition to the possibility for distraction, an especially sudden or potent stimulus (like the glare of a spotlight or a clap of thunder) can blind or deafen the Kindred for an hour or more.\n_System_: It takes a refexive action to activate this ability, but no roll or other cost is required. In certain circumstances, dice rolls associated with using the character\u2019s sense (such as ^Perception + Alertness^) decrease in difficulty by a number equal to the character\u2019s Auspex rating when the power is engaged. The Storyteller may also use this power to see if the character perceives a threat. In this case, the Storyteller privately rolls the character\u2019s unmodified Auspex rating, applying whatever difficulty he feels best suits the circumstances. For example, sensing that a pistol is pointed at the back of the character\u2019s head may require a roll of difficulty 5, while the sudden realization that a rival for Primogen is planning her assassination may require a 9. Note that even this \u201cprecognition\u201d comes only as a result of interpreting details the Kindred is able to notice. It\u2019s not an all-purpose insight or miraculous revelation. At the character\u2019s discretion, she may selectively heighten one specific sense, rather than leaving them all on. In these cases, the difficulty to perceive stimuli using that sense drops by one, but the difficulty to avoid distraction or temporary bedazzlement increases by one. This power does not let characters see in pitch darkness, as does Eyes of the Beast (p.199), but it does reduce difficulty penalties to act in such darkness from +2 to +1, and the character may make ranged attacks in pitch darkness if she can hear, smell, or otherwise detect her foe."

On its simplest level, Earthshock is the ability to hit the ground at point A, and subsequently have the force of the blow emerge from the ground at point B.\n_System_: The use of Earthshock requires the expenditure of two blood points, as well as a normal ^Dexterity + Brawl^ roll. The vampire punches or stamps on the ground, and, if the attack is a success, the force of the blow emerges from the ground as a geyser of stone and earth directly underneath the target. The attack can be dodged at a +2 difficulty. Earthshock\u2019s range is 10 feet or three meters for every level of Potence the vampire has, up to the limits of visibility. A failure on the attack roll means that the strike goes errant and is liable to explode anywhere within range; a botch means that the vampire pulverizes the ground beneath him and may well bury himself in the process."

The attack can come without warning, limiting the target\u2019s ability to dodge or anticipate; this makes Flick one of the most feared applications of Potence.\n_System_: Flick costs a point of blood, and requires a ^Dexterity + Brawl^ roll (difficulty 6).

The Warlocks claim that the Salubri use this power to remove the souls of their victims, alter them in horrible ways, or simply consume them and then make mindless slaves from the blasted husks. The truth is that the Cyclops use this power to rebuild a target\u2019s tattered soul, at the expense of their own mental fortitude. The Salubri draws the subject\u2019s soul out of his body, and into the vampire\u2019s third eye. There, the vampire repairs the soul. During this time, the target\u2019s body is vacant, but alive. It obeys the Salubri\u2019s commands (and the vampire must command it to eat and drink, or else it will starve - repairing the soul is not a quick undertaking). By a similar process, the character can cleanse a person, place, or object of demonic or evil infuence. This isn\u2019t a simple banishment, however. It is a battle, pitting the Salubri\u2019s moral and spiritual purity against whatever malign entity is present. If the Salubri loses the contest, she might lose her own soul in the process.\n_System_: This power may be used to draw out the soul of any character except those with Humanity or Path ratings of 1 or 0 or those who follow particularly inhuman Paths of Enlightenment - some souls are beyond redemption. The player rolls ^Stamina + Empathy^ (difficulty of 12 minus the subject\u2019s Humanity or Path rating). A botch gives the Salubri the subject\u2019s derangement for the remainder of the scene. The Salubri must make eye contact with the subject and the subject must be willing to be subjected to this power. A soul drawn out in this manner becomes part of the Salubri\u2019s soul while the healing process takes place. She may return it to its proper body at any time. While the soul is within the Salubri, she may spend a permanent Willpower point to restore a point to the subject\u2019s Humanity or Path rating. The Salubri may restore a maximum number of points equal to her Empathy rating, and may not raise the subject\u2019s Humanity or Path higher than the sum of his relevant Virtues (for example, a character subscribing to Humanity with Conscience 3 and Self-Control 3 could not have his Humanity raised above 6 in this manner). While a soul is being held by the Salubri, its body is an empty husk, comatose or in torpor, with no motivating force within it. A soul whose body is killed immediately vanishes, its disposition unknown to any (although the Salubri strongly suspect that souls that vanish in this manner are completely and irreversibly destroyed). Killing the body of a drawn-out soul may warrant a Conscience or Conviction roll if the killer knows of the soul\u2019s absence, at the Storyteller\u2019s discretion. If used to draw out a demon, the player spends a Willpower point if the subject is willing and the corrupting agent does not resist (a rare occurrence). If the subject is possessed by a conscious entity, the demon (or other foreign consciousness) fights the Salubri for dominance. This takes place via an extended, contested roll of the Salubri\u2019s ^Humanity or Path^ versus the opponent\u2019s Willpower (each party\u2019s difficulty is equal to the other\u2019s current Willpower). The winner is the first one to achieve three net successes more than the other. If the player fails, the attempt at purification also fails. If the player botches, the demon takes over the Salubri\u2019s body. This purification cannot be used on oneself and has no effect on the Beast or an alternate personality. Once the initial removal has been successfully performed, the player spends a second Willpower point. The Salubri thrusts the demon into a nearby item, animal, or person, trapping the demon in the selected vessel. This must be accomplished within two turns of the Purification and the target must be within physical reach. If this cannot be accomplished, the demon is likely to go free... or find another suitable vessel (such as the Salubri). If the vampire places the demon in a being who is likely to suffer from its presence, the player must make an immediate Conscience or Conviction roll (difficulty 8) if the Storyteller believes that the character\u2019s morality would object. A botch, in addition to the normal consequences, releases the demon into the world."

This allows the subject to ignore all wound penalties for one turn per success. A second application of this power may be made once the first one has expired, at the cost of another blood point and another Willpower roll. If the subject is unwilling for some reason, the player must make a contested ^Willpower^ roll against the subject (difficulty 8). To put a mortal to sleep, the same system applies. The mortal sleeps for five to 10 hours - whatever his normal sleep cycle is - and regains one temporary Willpower point upon awakening. He sleeps peacefully and does not suffer nightmares or the effects of any derangements while asleep. He may be awakened normally (or violently).

During this period, the player spends a number of blood points equal to twice the permanent Willpower of the subject. At the end of the ritual, the subject\u2019s body slips into a coma and dies by the end of the night. Many Tremere and other cautious Kindred warn that the Salubri may misrepresent themselves and convince others to volunteer for a \u201crelease\u201d from mortal concerns, when in truth they wish to trap the soul in another plane of existence. The subject\u2019s soul is released from her body and enters the astral plane (such as the Auspex power Psychic Projection on p.138). This separation is permanent and irreversible. The subject is treated as an astrally-projecting character in terms of rules mechanics. However, she no longer has a silver cord and no longer needs one, as she exists independently of her body. If she is reduced to zero Willpower through astral combat, she loses one point of permanent Willpower and reforms after a year and a day at the place where this power was used upon her. A character reduced to zero permanent Willpower is destroyed forever. This power may only be used upon mortals (excluding mages) and vampires who are in Golconda, and the subject must have a full understanding of what this ritual entails - including its permanence and the impossibility of a reversal. The body of a vampire who is Unbound decays at sunrise. It is possible to drink the blood remaining in the vampire\u2019s body, but no benefits are gained from an attempt at diablerie. Any attempt to Embrace the body of an Unbound mortal automatically fails. The free-flying soul may choose to dissipate, moving on to whatever awaits beyond death, at any time (and is therefore not a ghost).

In the modern nights, the last vestiges of the warrior Salubri are the <i>antitribu</i> of the Clan, and practice their Discipline of Valeren (see p. 474). The rest of the bloodline know the Discipline of Obeah. This Discipline allows the Salubri to judge and even improve a subject\u2019s health. As the vampire grows more powerful, Obeah lets her heal a target\u2019s soul directly. It is this power that forms the basis of the \u201csoulsucker\u201c charge that dogs the bloodline these nights.\n\nThis Discipline gives its practitioners a third eye in the center of the vampire\u2019s forehead when the Kindred masters the second level of Obeah."

The Stiff can raise a recently dead person as an undead servant. The zombie can\u2019t think critically or move faster than a quick walk, but it is tough, strong, and unquestioningly loyal.\n_System_: The first application of this power allows the Samedi to feed some of her blood to a recently dead corpse (maximum time since death equal to the Samedi\u2019s Stamina in weeks) in order to animate it. Three blood points must be spent to bring the corpse back to a semblance of life. A reanimated corpse has the same Physical Attributes as it did in life. It is capable of limited reasoning (reduce all Mental Attributes by one), but free thought is beyond it and the only person it can clearly understand is its master or an individual who its master has directed it to obey. Reanimated corpses possess two levels of Fortitude and three extra health levels. They suffer no dice pool penalties from wounds until they lose their last health level, at which point they collapse and cannot be reanimated again. A reanimated corpse crumbles to dust at the third sunrise after its creation. Its \u201clifespan\u201d can be extended by feeding it more blood at creation - one blood point per extra night.\nThis power can also be used on a mortal. The Samedi creates a ghoul in the normal fashion, by feeding the subject one blood point. The player then rolls ^Manipulation + Medicine^ (difficulty equal to the mortal\u2019s permanent Willpower). Three or more successes are required to turn the mortal into a zombie. If this roll succeeds, the mortal loses all free will, becoming completely subjugated to the Samedi\u2019s command. The mortal may try to break free once per night by rolling his Willpower (difficulty equal to the Samedi\u2019s ^Manipulation + Leadership^). If the mortal frees himself, he is still considered a ghoul but regains his free will and normal Mental and Social Attributes (see below). A mortal who botches his Willpower roll or who becomes blood-bound to the Samedi may never again attempt to break free.\nA mortal under the infuence of Putrescent Servitude becomes pale and corpse-like. He loses one point from all Social and Mental Attributes (to a minimum value of one). He gains three extra health levels and takes no dice pool penalties from injuries until he reaches Incapacitated, at which point he collapses. One more lethal wound will kill him once he reaches this point. The mortal also gains one level of Potence, as a normal ghoul would, and has the potential to learn other Disciplines if the Samedi feels inclined to teach him. A ghoul zombie who goes a month without vampiric blood loses all benefits of being a ghoul, as would normally occur. He also loses all effects of this power and regains his free will, though he may still be blood-bound to his master."

Those within the cloud lose all sense of sight and feel as though they\u2019ve been immersed in pitch. Sound also warps and distorts within the cloud, making it nearly impossible to accomplish anything (+2 difficulty, as per Blind Fighting on p.274). Even those possessed of Heightened Senses, Eyes of the Beast, Tongue of the Asp, and similar powers suffer the penalty for blindness due to the unnatural darkness. Additionally, being surrounded by the Shroud of Night reduces Stamina-based dice pools by two dice, as the murk smothers and agitates the victims. This effect is not cumulative with Shadow Play, although targets asphyxiate as per Shadow Play if they reach 0 Stamina; more than one unfortunate mortal has \u201cdrowned\u201d in darkness. Mortals and animals surrounded by the Shroud of Night must make Courage rolls per Shadow Play, above, or panic and flee."

Though still humanoid, the vampire takes on an almost demonic appearance, as the darkness within him bubbles to the surface.\n_System_: The player spends two blood points and makes a ^Manipulation + Courage^ roll (difficulty 7) - vampires of lower Generation may have to take two turns to make the transition. Failure indicates the vampire cannot undergo the Black Metamorphosis (though he spends the blood points nonetheless). A botch inflicts two unsoakable health levels of lethal damage on the vampire as darkness ravages his undead body.\nWhile under the effects of the Black Metamorphosis, the vampire possesses four tentacles similar to those evoked via Arms of the Abyss (though their Strength and Dexterity ratings are equal to the vampire\u2019s own Attributes, including dice from Celerity and Potence).

This is not cumulative with other powers in Obtenebration, although targets can asphyxiate at Stamina 0, as per Shadow Play. The vampire may make an additional attack without penalty by using the tentacles (for a total of two attacks, not one additional attack per tentacle). Additionally, the vampire can sense his surroundings fully even in pitch darkness. The vampire\u2019s head and extremities sometimes appear to fade away into nothingness, while at other times they seem swathed in otherworldly darkness. This, combined with the wriggling tentacles writhing from his body, creates an unsettling sight. Mortals, animals, and other creatures not accustomed to this sort of display must make Courage rolls (difficulty 8) or succumb to a panic that amounts to R\u00f6tschreck (though it is inspired by the darkness rather than fire).

The vampire who has mastered Blood Sweat is capable of inducing these feelings in a subject to a preternatural degree. The victim experiences a torrential outpouring of vitae if he harbors the tiniest shred of remorse for any action he has ever undertaken.\n_System_: The character must be within line of sight of the subject and spend three turns concentrating. The player spends a Willpower point and rolls ^Manipulation + Intimidation^ (difficulty equal to the target\u2019s current Willpower points). The target loses one blood point per success. Mortals sustain injury as if they had lost blood from being fed upon. The target actually \u201csweats out\u201d the lost blood in a sudden rush of sanguinary perspiration that soaks his clothes. Large amounts may even form puddles at his feet. Blood lost through this process is considered dead, inert mortal blood, and provides minimal nutrition (half normal) for Cainites desperate enough to lick it up from the foor or wring it out of towels. It provides no sustenance for the individual from whom it emerged. In addition to the blood loss, the victim is overcome by a sense of remorse and guilt for his past transgressions (if he has a strong conscience) or an overwhelming compulsion to brag (if he is of sufficiently coarse moral character). The severity of this impulse depends on the number of successes rolled: One success could cause a slight twinge of conscience, while five successes may result in the subject breaking down and pouring out a full confession of his crimes. This effect is more story-oriented than mechanical, and the Storyteller is the final authority on what the victim feels compelled to confess or boast. Note that this power\u2019s existence is not widely known.

Ripples of the Heart allows a Cainite to leave emotions within the bloodstream of any mortal from whom he feeds. Any other vampire who subsequently drinks from that mortal experiences those emotions as if they were his own.\n_System_: The character drinks at least one blood point from the subject mortal then spends a minute in physical contact with the subject while concentrating on the emotion he wishes to leave in her blood. The player spends a point of Willpower and rolls ^Charisma + Empathy^ (difficulty 7 under normal circumstances, 5 if the subject is currently experiencing the intended emotion, 9 if he is currently experiencing a strong opposite emotion). The subject\u2019s blood carries the weight of the intended emotion for one lunar month per success rolled. A mortal\u2019s blood can only carry one emotion at a time. Subsequent attempts to use Ripples of the Heart on the same individual have no effect until the previous application has worn off. Any vampire who drinks from a vessel under the effects of Ripples of the Heart must succeed in a Self-Control/Instinct roll (difficulty of the mortal\u2019s current Willpower points) as soon as she swallows the first blood point. If she fails this roll, the vitae-borne emotion immediately overtakes her. The strength of the emotion depends on how many blood points she drinks. One blood point results in a momentary mood swing, two causes a significant shift in demeanor, and three or more generates a complete change in emotional state. Depending on the circumstances and the precise emotion, the effects of this may be spectacular or catastrophic. A vampire overtaken by romantic passion may temporarily believe she is in love with the mortal(or any other convenient bystander). One who drinks from a hate-infused vessel may rend her prey to shreds, and one who takes a draught of a mortal touched with fear may run away screaming. The vampire remains subject to the emotion for a number of hours equal to the mortal\u2019s permanent Willpower, though she is still subject to other feelings after the initial rush of sensation. The mortal who is under the effects of Ripples of the Heart is unaware of the power\u2019s effects on him, though he is slightly predisposed toward the emotion in question while the power is in effect.

Selective Silence allows the skilled Cainite to overcome these limitations by silencing only those individuals or objects that she wants to silence. When using this power, most individuals exhale a thin mist of blood that clings to the selected subjects, gradually evaporating as Selective Silence\u2019s effects fade. Some vampires also use a similar technique when invoking Silence of Death, in which case the mist surrounds them and moves with them.\n_System_: The player spends two blood points and rolls ^Stamina + Stealth^ (difficulty 7). Each success allows for one individual or object that the character can silence with this use of the power. Each subject must be within 20 yards or meters of the character. Objects larger than a man count as more than one subject: a heavy machine gun counts as two, a car as three, and a small aircraft as five. Objects larger than a private jet or creatures larger than an elephant cannot be silenced through the use of this power.

Rather than purging foreign taints from the body, Purification allows its wielder to cleanse other individuals\u2019 minds and souls of stains, including those left by the mind control of other Kindred.

By concentrating, the Kindred bursts her target\u2019s blood vessels and fills his lungs with vitae that strangles him from within. The blood actually constricts the target\u2019s body from the inside as it floods through his system; thus, it works even on unbreathing Kindred. Until the target collapses in agony or death throes, this power has no visible effect, and many Kindred like it because it leaves no trace of their presence.\n_System_: The vampire must touch her target prior to using Dagon\u2019s Call. Within an hour thereafter, the vampire may issue the call, though she need not be in the presence or even in the line of sight of her target. Invoking the power costs one Willpower point. The Kindred\u2019s player makes a contested Stamina roll against the target\u2019s Stamina; the difficulty of each roll is equal to the opponent\u2019s permanent Willpower rating. The number of successes the vampire using Dagon\u2019s Call achieves is the amount of lethal damage, in health levels, the victim suffers. For an additional point of Willpower spent in the next turn, the vampire may continue using Dagon\u2019s Call by engaging in another contested Stamina roll. So long as the Kindred\u2019s player continues to spend Willpower, the character may continue rending her opponent from within."

For a number of months equal to the number of successes, any other vampire who drinks that mortal\u2019s blood sustains two health levels of aggravated damage for every blood point imbibed. This damage manifests as a combination of acid burns and something akin to toxic shock. While a mortal is poisonous to vampires, his body\u2019s alchemical balance is slightly altered toward toxicity. He gains two extra points of Stamina for the purposes of resisting the effects and damage of poisons and acids.

However, its effects on its victims are spectacular enough to make the loss of even the most treasured blades worthwhile. This power\u2019s effects are of very limited duration, as the substance it creates will quickly evaporate away.\n_System_: The character coats an edged weapon with her own blood, as per Baal\u2019s Caress. The player spends one or more blood points and rolls ^Willpower^ (difficulty 7). The weapon now does aggravated damage. It also gains a number of additional damage dice equal to the number of successes rolled plus the number of blood points spent. These extra dice fade at a rate of one per turn as the poison dissipates, drips off, and reacts with the weapon\u2019s material. Once the extra damage dice are all gone, the weapon\u2019s base damage dice begin to fade at the same rate. The weapon breaks if used when its base damage is reduced to the wielder\u2019s Strength or less. The only weapons that can resist this corrosion are those created with a supernatural power of a level equal to or greater than the character\u2019s Quietus rating, though even this is subject to the Storyteller\u2019s discretion. Baal\u2019s Bloody Talons is subject to the same limitations as Baal\u2019s Caress, except the limit on the number of successful strikes that do aggravated damage. A weapon affected by Baal\u2019s Bloody Talons does aggravated damage with every successful attack until it is destroyed. At the Storyteller\u2019s discretion, the character may use the venom this power produces for other purposes, such as burning through a padlock or destroying an incriminating tape.

Baal\u2019s Caress may be used to augment any bladed weapon; everything from poisoned knives and swords to tainted fingernails and claws has been reported.\n_System_: Baal\u2019s Caress does not increase the damage done by a given weapon, but that weapon inflicts aggravated damage rather than normal. No roll is necessary to activate this power, but one blood point is consumed per hit. For example, if a Cainite poisons his knife and strikes his opponent (even if he inflicts no damage), one blood point\u2019s worth of lubrication disappears.

Particularly strong-willed or hardened subjects may shrug off these visions as daydreams, but those who are less self-possessed can be permanently changed by the experience. A side effect of the use of this power is the partial destruction of the vitae from which the images are drawn. Some viziers theorize that this is the result of motes of the vessels\u2019 consciousness making an effort to escape their usurper.\n_System_: The character touches his target and spends a turn in concentration.

If the target has committed diablerie within a number of nights equal to the character\u2019s Perception, the attacker gains one automatic success. The result depends on the number of net successes the attacker rolls.

For example, a character with three dots in Occult, from whom a Kiasyd steals one, retains an Occult of 2. If a Kiasyd takes fewer dots than she already has in a given Ability, these points do not serve to raise her own rating (In the previous example,the Kiasyd would not increase his Occult rating if he already had a rating of one or more, as he took only one dot).

From a philosophical perspective, however, worlds of difference separate the two. The Tremere force every piece of knowledge they incorporate into the structured, rigid framework of high Hermetic invocation. By contrast, the sorcerer caste\u2019s practices are the result of millennia of adaptation and melding, and are too disparate to be considered \u201cstructured\u201d in any real sense. The modern body of knowledge that is Assamite Sorcery draws its content from a wide array of magical traditions, from the ecstatic rites of Kali and Shiva\u2019s followers to the subtle precision of feng shui to the elegant symbolic and mathematical transformations of Islamic alchemists and astronomers.\n\nAssamite Sorcery is mechanically identical to the more common Thaumaturgy that appears on pp. 212-240. However, though they work on similar principles (the use of vampiric vitae to fuel exertions of conscious will in order to effect change upon the physical or spiritual world), the two are not cross-compatible. A Tremere strives to perform his magic the same way, all the time, every time. An Assamite might never enact the same ritual the same exact way twice in a millennium.\n\nAs may be expected, students of Assamite Sorcery have great difficulty learning the practices of other blood magic traditions. All experience points costs to learn other blood magic paths and rituals are increased by half (round up) for Assamite sorcerers. In addition, even once the sorcerer has incorporated these lessons into her repertoire, they are still alien to her. All invocations of a \u201cforeign\u201d path require one extra blood point and all rituals take triple the normal time and require one extra success for any desired result."

It is a trivial matter to accelerate time in a compressed rush, aging a target decades or even centuries in the blink of an eye. It is far more difficult to absorb and unweave entropy, lessening time\u2019s hold. This power does not reverse history in any way; it merely reverses or accelerates the effects of time in terms of wear and tear. Moreover, a target cannot regress to an earlier or incomplete state of being. For inanimate objects, this is the point at which they were assembled. For living beings, it is either adult maturity or the time of birth (or its equivalent). For the undead and other corpses, it is the moment of death.\n_System_: In order for the vampire to age a target, the player spends two blood points and rolls ^Manipulation + Occult^. The difficulty equals the target\u2019s true physical age in decades or effective physical age in the case of target\u2019s that have aged unnaturally, such as by means of this power. This difficulty cannot rise higher than 10 or drop below 4. The vampire touches the target and concentrates for a turn. The Cainite may age the target a maximum number of years as determined by the following table, although his player may choose to apply a lesser effect. The Storyteller remains the final arbiter of time\u2019s effect on an object, but living beings aged past their natural lifespan quickly perish.\n<table><tr><th>Successes</th><th>Elapsed Time</th></tr><tr><td>1 success</td><td>up to one year</td></tr><tr><td>2 successes</td><td>up to five years</td></tr><tr><td>3 successes</td><td>up to 10 years</td></tr><tr><td>4 successes</td><td>up to 50 years</td></tr><tr><td>5 successes</td><td>up to 100 years</td></tr><tr><td>6+ successes</td><td>up to one century per success over 5</td></tr></table>Removing the effects of time requires greater effort, increasing the difficulty of the activation roll by one. In addition, the vampire suffers one level of unsoakable lethal damage for every success her player chooses to apply. As noted, objects cannot return to an earlier or incomplete state. A silver coin may lose its tarnish and seem newly minted, but it will not revert to an unformed block of metal. Likewise, while an adult may revert to the cusp of his adulthood or a child to a new-born, neither could regress to a pre-natal state. Also, this power only accounts for damage and wear due to time. A child amputee reverted to a baby will not regenerate her missing arm, nor will a broken sword become anything but finely crafted shards. In either application, this power does not change a subject\u2019s mental or mystical properties. Sentient beings retain all memories and any derangements. A vampire regressed to the point of death remains a vampire, not an inanimate corpse - and the regressed Cainite still remembers all Disciplines and keeps any changes in Generation due to diablerie.

Other uses include the maddening infliction of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu to induce paranoia or make a victim question her senses and her sanity.\n_System_: The vampire concentrates on a single victim in his line of sight. The player rolls ^Manipulation + Occult^ (difficulty equal to the victim\u2019s current Willpower). With any successes, the victim falls into a light trance and relives the most recent experiences that preceded her fugue. Alternately, the vampire may evoke another set of specific memories and circumstances from the victim\u2019s past, provided that he has some means of telepathically drawing them forth. The recurring events must be relatively benign, insofar as nothing noteworthy happens or nothing happens that would demand the victim\u2019s immediate action. Thus, in the example of the sentry, the vampire could entrance him and walk past unobserved, but not if the sentry spotted him before invoking the power.

For projectiles, multiply any successes to hit and final damage by the speed factor, rounded down. Similarly apply the speed modifier to the successes of other actions involving Dexterity, Wits, or Strength for slowed characters.

Failure does nothing apart from wasting effort and blood, while a botch inflicts one level of aggravated damage for every 1 rolled.

Some True Brujah scholars use this to observe history as it truly occurred, while others look to the past for aid or to retrieve lost possessions. At least two coordinated attempts by the True Brujah to summon their Antediluvian progenitor have met with catastrophic failure. No one knows if a Sage capable of this power remains. The hope is that Clio\u2019s Kiss faded from knowledge - the bloodline cannot afford a third attempt.\n_System_: The player spends half of the character\u2019s current blood pool, rounded up, and rolls ^Stamina + Occult^ (difficulty 8). This power automatically fails if the player spends fewer than five blood points. The number of successes determines the maximum amount of time through which the character may reach:\n<table><tr><th>Successes</th><th>Time</th></tr><tr><td>1 success</td><td>24 hours</td></tr><tr><td>2 successes</td><td>one month</td></tr><tr><td>3 successes</td><td>one year</td></tr><tr><td>4 successes</td><td>10 years</td></tr><tr><td>5+ successes</td><td>one century per success over 4</td></tr></table>When a vampire uses this power successfully, the scene she seeks to retrieve materializes around her, briefy supplanting the current environment. This change extends to a maximum volume of a ballroom or similarly proportioned outdoor space (at Storyteller\u2019s discretion). The power affects everyone inside this area by granting them awareness of the summoned events, but the vampire is the only person who may choose to interact with the scene (though he may remain invisible and disembodied). All others must remain incorporeal observers until time reasserts itself and the scene fades. They may move about to change their vantage point, but can take no other action.\nIf the vampire wants to remove an object or individual from the scene, bringing them forward to the present, the player must spend a dot of Willpower. Once this is done, the conjured scene fades away and present reality returns. Only the summoned object or person remains.\nThis power can never alter the course of history in any significant manner. Should an object or person have a meaningful role yet to play at the time it is removed, the weight of time crashes upon the vampire and he vanishes in its current. Whether such folly results in destruction or propels the vampire far into the future remains unknown and likely unknowable. Like-wise, any changes the vampire makes to a summoned scene unravel as soon as he departs. Like a play, time may be altered by the removal of extras, but the script stays the same - however cruel a fate, Carthage must be destroyed. As always, the Storyteller remains the final judge of what this power can achieve and need not reveal all limitations until a vampire attempts a change. It is possible to summon a person from a point close to his death, assuming he perished without observers. Likewise, a manuscript destroyed when the Library of Alexandria burned can be called after it is last read. Calling the very library from Alexandria would be impossible, not only for its size but also the necessity and significance of its ruins. Finally, the previous form of a currently existing object cannot be summoned, if only because its continued existence validates a role in history. Storytellers need not consider every ramification of paradox, but this power has tremendous potential for abuse and should be adjudicated accordingly."

            "description": "<p>The Daughters of Cacophony emerged as a distinct bloodline sometime during the 19th century. Before that, of course, there were always Kindred who saw music and song as a way to remain sane. Kindred scholars believe that the Daughters sprang from the blood of either Clan Toreador (for their passionate artistic pursuit) or Malkavian (given their propensity for causing madness), but their supernatural powers point more toward Clan Ventrue. It\u2019s something of a moot point, as the \u201cfirst\u201d Daughter of Cacophony is unknown. Regardless of their origins, the Sirens (as they are called in Kindred circles) are all singers, and the bloodline has always been predominantly female.</p><p>Indeed, the Daughters of Cacophony base their unlives on song. They wander through eternity with music always in their ears, and that makes them seem unfocused or flighty to other Kindred. This is one of the reasons, along with their rarity, that neither major Sect of vampires considers them a threat or much more than a diversion. Individual Kindred, however, might have occasion to meet a Siren and wonder why it is that those who spend too much time listening to their songs always seemed changed by the experience.</p><p><b>Nickname:</b> Sirens</p><p><b>Sect:</b> Sirens might fall in with whichever Sect holds power locally. If asked, most Daughters either identify as independents or claim membership in the Camarilla.</p><p><b>Appearance:</b> A Siren might be a street musician dressed in thrift-store chic, a pierced and tattooed punk rocker, or a high-class entertainer with money and prestige. Apart from the fact that the Daughters are largely female, their appearance varies widely.</p><p><b>Haven:</b> Most Sirens have a quiet room with good acoustics where they can sing without anyone listening. As much as most Daughters love performing, they would prefer to be alone after the \u201cshow\u201d ends, and so the outward appearance of their havens isn\u2019t as important as maintaining its secrecy.</p><p><b>Background:</b> The majority of Sirens were singers before the Embrace as well. Very occasionally, a Daughter Embraces someone who never developed her skill at singing, but these discover their talents swiftly.</p><p>The Daughters do not discriminate based on musical style. Jazz singer, nu-metal waif, opera diva, sultry lounge performer \u2014 any chanteuse might be a Siren.</p><p><b>Character Creation:</b> Social Attributes tend to be primary. Expression and Performance are almost always high, and many have Fame. Sirens who die with a following reap the benefit of their fans (Herd). Those less lucky often still have Contacts in show business.</p><p><b>Clan Disciplines:</b> Fortitude, Melpominee, Presence</p><p><b>Weakness:</b> The Daughters of Cacophony hear music constantly. This might be a form of synesthesia, or it might be a hallucination. This constant song distracts the Daughters as much as it guides them. The difficulties of all their Perception rolls increase by two. No Daughter of Cacophony may have Alertness above 3 dots.</p><p><b>Organization:</b> Their numbers are too small for them to be truly organized, yet sometimes the Sirens act as one. Every so often, Sirens everywhere put on a performance on the same night. They don\u2019t necessarily sing the same songs, but all of the waking Sirens sing at exactly the same time.</p><div class=ttlStereo><h3>Stereotypes</h3><p><b>Camarilla:</b> <i>Would you like to hear another, my lord?</i></p><p><b>Sabbat:</b> <i>Very well.

Their regard for such ideas as redemption and salvation are cynical at best, and much of the pomp that shaped the Clan\u2019s pre-Sabbat outlook remains only with a sense of blackest irony or open mockery.

Wealthier Keepers and those who predate the Sect often maintain their own havens, whether sinister penthouse suites or sprawling Old World villas.</p><p><b>Background:</b> Prospective sires of Clan Lasombra seek both erudition and ambition in their potential childer. As such, many Lasombra come from professional backgrounds, and display outgoing and even aggressive personalities. Merit in their sires\u2019 eyes takes fledgling Lasombra far, and the Keepers do not hesitate to cull their ranks of flawed, lazy, or boorish childer.</p><p><b>Character Creation:</b> Lasombra often have disparate Natures and Demeanors. Mental or Social Attributes are equally likely to be primary. Attributes tend to be narrow and specialized, showing individual expertise. Keepers cultivate Backgrounds of all types similarly in (initially) low quantities, to better diversify themselves.</p><p><b>Clan Disciplines:</b> Dominate, Obtenebration, Potence</p><p><b>Weaknesses:</b> Lasombra vampires cast no reflections. Whether in a mirror, in a body of water, on a polished surface, or in the rear-view of a taxicab, the image of the Keeper does not reflect.</p><p><b>Organization:</b> For the Lasombra, the nights of high aristocracy never faded, and the titles and offices a modern onlooker might associate with history still carry great weight among the Keepers. A complex system of patronage, mentorship, and lineage characterizes the Clan, similar to the courts and churches of centuries gone by. Childer benefit greatly from esteemed sires and vice versa, while acts that confer Sect or Clan status may also elevate a Lasombra\u2019s peers, so long as she associates her success with her fellows.</p><div class=ttlStereo><h3>Stereotypes</h3><p><b>Assamite:</b> <i>They believe themselves lions but possess only the ways of jackals.</i></p><p><b>Brujah:</b> <i>Petulant whelps in a rage over their own loss of rule from a self-fulfilling prophecy.</i></p><p><b>Followers of Set:</b> <i>Peer too deeply into the darkness, serpent, and you shall find that it has the means to smite.</i></p><p><b>Gangrel:</b> <i>Every society needs its beasts of burden.</i></p><p><b>Giovanni:</b> <i>Their inner foulness manifests in their every action.</i></p><p><b>Malkavian:</b> <i>The fool does not dine at the table with the lords.</i></p><p><b>Nosferatu:</b> <i>They are martyrs, not monsters, and their faces are the stigmata they must bear.</i></p><p><b>Ravnos:</b> <i>Filth, suitable only from which to make an example.</i></p><p><b>Toreador:</b> <i>A rose plucked from its garden remains lovely for only so long before it crumbles to dust.</i></p><p><b>Tremere:</b> <i>They revere only themselves, and they will reap a just reward for the sacrilege they practice.</i></p><p><b>Tzimisce:</b> <i>Although we may share a common goal, a murder of crows is always an ill omen.</i></p><p><b>Ventrue:</b> <i>Such a misguided effort, to use the scepter of kings only to hide oneself from his lessers.</i></p><p><b>Caitiff:</b> <i>Lords have ever sired bastards, and have ever hidden them as their marks of shame.</i></p><p><b>Camarilla:</b> <i>Who would wish to dwell in a castle that closes its gates for fear of unruly peasants?</i></p><p><b>Sabbat:</b> <i>Imperfect, and thus in need of ever more investment.</i></p><p><b>Anarchs:</b> <i>They must never be equals \u2014 it is enough that they think they are.</i></p></div><p class=ttlQuote><b>Quote:</b> <i>Wielding the shadows is an extension of controlling the darkness into which we are all Embraced.</i></p>"

Theirs was the glory of ancient Carthage, but Ventrue treachery in ancient Rome brought the dream to an end. Since then, the Brujah have borne a grudge.</p><p>Tonight, the Brujah are rebels and provocateurs, bat-swinging hooligans and agents of change in a society long crippled by stasis. As rebels, it\u2019s in their nature to challenge the status quo \u2014 though sometimes, without adequate opposition, they embody the status quo themselves. It works out fine, because there\u2019s always a hot-blooded Brujah waiting in the wings to bring down an uppity Clanmate grown too comfortable in the role of rebel-turned-dictator.</p><p>More so than any other Clan, the Brujah still feel the flames of the passions that once inspired them as mortals. Clan Brujah loves a cause and is quick to act on a stirring speech, accusation of injustice, or a call to arms. This connection to passion can be a blessing, but inspiration can also yield to the madness and hunger of the Beast.</p><p>No wise Prince turns his back on the Brujah, and rare is the Brujah who would allow herself to be manipulated or pandered to. A Brujah is her own master, first and foremost, and those who would bring her to heel face a terrible task. A Brujah who thinks she\u2019s getting the short end of the stick will tear an enemy to ribbons first and maybe remember to ask questions later, no matter if he\u2019s a Primogen or a mortal authority.</p><p>Some Kindred historians claim that the Brujah have parlayed their ancient betrayal into a role as agitators against the very order that they help support. Others claim the Brujah have long since submitted to the will of that same order, being little more than loyal opposition rendered impotent. Most Brujah don\u2019t care either way, as long as someone needs a good ass-kicking and they can be the ones to deliver it.</p><p><b>Nickname:</b> Rabble</p><p><b>Sect:</b> For all its rebellion, Clan Brujah generally considers itself a member of the Camarilla. Young Rabble sometimes look to the wildness of the Sabbat, but elders assert that the Ivory Tower provides a fine structure against which to rage.</p><p><b>Appearance:</b> Many Brujah affect styles and mannerisms that reflect an attitude of rebellion. Multicolored hair, shaven heads, spikes, rivets, fetish gear, and t-shirts with bold slogans might appeal to a Brujah. While not every Brujah wears the \u201cuniform,\u201d the Rabble often enjoy adorning themselves in outfits intended to provoke. Some young Brujah prefer mobile devices as their tools of resistance, and can summon a riot at the touch of a screen.</p><p><b>Haven:</b> Brujah may feel kinship to a city, but they rarely develop such ties to individual locations. Thus, at any given time, a Brujah probably has a half-dozen or more hideouts, safehouses, and flats available. These are often shabby and ill-kept until the Brujah needs them. Brujah havens might also have mortals who follow the Brujah\u2019s ideology or his cult of personality. This works out fine: It never hurts to have a spare vessel in an emergency.</p><p><b>Background:</b> As creatures of passion, Brujah often Embrace without really thinking much about it, and their childer tend to be a disparate lot. Sometimes, the Rabble Embrace those who share a similar outlook or enthusiasm for a cause as the prospective sire. Other times, they inflict the Embrace on those of opposite ideology, cursing a rival with vampirism as punishment.</p><p><b>Character Creation:</b> Brujah are usually \u2014 though not exclusively \u2014 drawn from mortals with violent or ungovernable personalities. Their Natures and Demeanors are often similar, as Brujah have little use for guile. They lean toward physical Attributes, with Social and Mental about equal afterwards. Many favor Skills and Talents, but most respect the Knowledges that make them more than just thugs. Contacts, Allies, and Herd are common Backgrounds.</p><p><b>Clan Disciplines:</b> Celerity, Potence, Presence</p><p><b>Weaknesses:</b> The same passions that inspire Brujah to greatness or depravity, left unchecked, can send them into incandescent rages: The difficulties of rolls to resist or guide frenzy (p. 298) are two higher than normal. Additionally, a Brujah may never spend Willpower to avoid frenzy, though he may spend a point of Willpower to end a frenzy that has already begun.</p><p><b>Organization:</b> Certain causes rise and fall in Brujah fashion, but some of the more tenured are those who call themselves Idealists and Iconoclasts. Iconoclasts want to tear it all down, while Idealists enjoy solving problems through theory. This last harkens somewhat to the classical roots of the Brujah as philosopher-kings, and most Idealists are among the ranks of Brujah ancillae and elders.</p><div class=ttlStereo><h3>Stereotypes</h3><p><b>Assamite:</b> <i>Fast, invisible, fanatical, and they want to drink my fucking blood?

            "description": "<p>A glint of red eyes in the darkness, the scent of a predator\u2019s musk, a flash of fangs, the sound of flesh tearing: These mark the presence of the Gangrel. More than any other Clan, the Gangrel resemble the beasts associated with the legends of vampires: bats, wolves, and other creatures of darkness. Indeed, the Outlanders may develop the ability to transform themselves into these and other, more primal forms.</p><p>The Gangrel have other characteristics in common with animals as well. Many shun the elaborate social constructs of both Kindred and kine. A number of them prefer to move alone or as a member of small packs or coteries. Most are tough and, when pressed, ferocious. And when Gangrel succumb to the depredations of the Beast, they are left with some feature redolent of the animal kingdom.</p><p>As a Clan, the Gangrel are wary and aloof. Most would prefer to spend their nights stalking prey or wilding on the rooftops than minding Princely edicts or lobbying for recognition of domain. Theirs is a tense relationship with vampire society, and Outlanders are among the most frequent to turn Anarch or Autarkis. In some localities, the Gangrel have collectively abandoned membership in any Sect \u2014 insofar as the Gangrel truly ever do anything collectively.</p><p>The Jyhad seems less pronounced among the Gangrel than it is among other Clans, and the Outlanders have little regard for the eternal conflict. Differences between Gangrel more often fall along the lines of domain and feeding rights than they do on generational mistrust, and the things that concern young Outlanders are matters that concern Gangrel ancillae and even elders. Still, one would be hard-pressed to consider the relationship among Gangrel of different generations amicable, except in isolated sire-childe situations. The Beast is ever suspicious of those who would take sustenance from it.</p><p><b>Nickname:</b> Outlanders</p><p><b>Sect:</b> The Gangrel at least nominally belong to the Camarilla, but the Clan has always had a vocal faction that spurns membership in any Sect. They claim that political games and social structures do nothing for the primal Gangrel.</p><p><b>Appearance:</b> Personal presentation is often not high on the list of many Gangrel priorities, and a Gangrel\u2019s appearance is often more a matter of circumstance than it is of active decision. The Clan\u2019s weakness can contribute a great deal to their appearance, as does an extended unlife in the places where they make their havens, which are frequently short of modern conveniences.</p><p><b>Haven:</b> Gangrel often lair where they can, taking refuge when the sun threatens to rise. Those who do maintain permanent havens often lean toward the utilitarian: Everything from a cave to a covered alley to an illegal squat may serve as a Gangrel haven, usually with little demarcating them as any sort of personal territory (until it\u2019s too late for the unfortunate interloper).</p><p><b>Background:</b> Gangrel sire childer like they seek prey: after long hunts during which the prospective childe doesn\u2019t even know she\u2019s being followed. Creating a fledgling means sharing limited resources, so each sire-childe relationship is unique and significant. Outlanders Embrace because they choose an individual, not out of whim or recklessness. Those who earn their attention are hardy, whether physically or emotionally.</p><p><b>Character Creation:</b> Sufficiency is the Gangrel hallmark, and many have outsider or loner personality archetypes. Physical Attributes are far and away most frequent, as are Talents with a smattering of Skills and Knowledges. Many Gangrel focus on Disciplines rather than Backgrounds, preferring to rely on themselves more than others. Gangrel almost never have significant Resources, Influence, or Retainers.</p><p><b>Clan Disciplines:</b> Animalism, Fortitude, Protean</p><p><b>Weaknesses:</b> Every time a Gangrel frenzies, she acquires a temporary animal characteristic (which may replace an existing temporary one). A patch of fur, a brief torpor after feeding, or skittishness around crowds \u2014 all of these may mar an Outlander after frenzy. Characteristics acquired in Gangrel frenzies need not only be physical \u2013 they can be behavioral as well.

These are informal affairs, geared more toward sharing information and revelry than advancing any cogent agenda. Aside from these infrequent gatherings, almost all Gangrel organization is very local where it exists at all, from pairs of sire-and-childe through terrifying packs centered around one accomplished Outlander.</p><div class=ttlStereo><h3>Stereotypes</h3><p><b>Assamite:</b> <i>Pull off the fucking head and the body will die.</i></p><p><b>Brujah:</b> <i>I wouldn\u2019t call what we have \u201ctrust.\u201d More of an understanding that we have a common enemy.</i></p><p><b>Followers of Set:</b> <i>If it smells like carrion, I don\u2019t want any part of it.</i></p><p><b>Giovanni:</b> <i>I try to make it a habit not to keep talking to things once I\u2019ve killed them.</i></p><p><b>Lasombra:</b> <i>I\u2019m not afraid of the dark, so you\u2019d better have something else underneath that cape.</i></p><p><b>Malkavian:</b> <i>Ten gallons of bullshit in a one-gallon jug.</i></p><p><b>Nosferatu:</b> <i>When they get nervous, get the fuck out of there.</i></p><p><b>Ravnos:</b> <i>If she starts calling you her brother, pop your claws and make your point.

But their aversion to iron, their odd power of Mytherceria, and their very appearance speak to even stranger ancestry.</p><p>The Kiasyd are independent, focused more on their studies than on the causes of the Sword of Caine. The ones that do claim membership in the Sabbat aren\u2019t passionately involved in the Sect\u2019s activities. Some speculate that the Lasombra hold some power over them \u2014 did the Keepers create the Kiasyd, the way the Tzimisce created the Blood Brothers? Do the Kiasyd, whatever their origin, owe the Lasombra some debt? Whatever the nature of their relationship, it seems to benefit the Sabbat.</p><p>The Kiasyd are, as a rule, calm and studious. They prefer to remain ensconced within their havens, poring over ancient texts, maps, artifacts, and other bits of antiquity. Other Kindred, it seems, can\u2019t understand how a lineage of vampires that is so very strange could be nothing more than scholars. To hear the rumor-mill tell it, the Kiasyd can feed only on the blood of infants, or faeries, or unspoiled virgins.

Since the Kiasyd don\u2019t spend much time around each other if they can help it (see below), drawing a conclusion about their collective preferences is difficult.</p><p><b>Appearance:</b> The Kiasyd aren\u2019t called \u201cWeirdlings\u201d just because of their behavior. Most of them are well over six feet tall (two meters or more), willowy, and thin. Their skin isn\u2019t just pale, as with most vampires, but glows faintly in moonlight. Their eyes are almond-shaped and have no visible pupils. They are often violet or jet black in color. Their ears are slightly pointed. The Kiasyd cover this with a hat or headband when going out amongst mortals, but even so, their height and skin tone make them stand out.</p><p><b>Haven:</b> Most Kiasyd spend years building up their havens, improving security, library facilities, and other amenities. They are fiercely protective of their homes, and they do not allow guests without explicit invitations. When they do invite guests, however, they treat them well, offering vintage vitae, comfortable rooms and, of course, plenty of reading material.</p><p><b>Background:</b> Museum curators, talented students, librarians, rare book experts, and academics of all stripes are likely choices for Kiasyd Embraces. The Weirdlings want their progeny to be studious, polite, and educated, and they don\u2019t want to take the time instructing them in the basics of erudite understanding.</p><p><b>Character Creation:</b> Mental Attributes and Knowledges are usually primary, though all Kiasyd have some degree of Etiquette.

It remains to be seen what effect Koldunic Sorcery will have on the world at large.</p><p><b>Nickname:</b> None</p><p><b>Disciplines:</b> The kolduns aren\u2019t truly a bloodline. Rather, koldunism is a practice within the Tzimisce where the vampire learns Koldunic Sorcery (at out-of-Clan costs). Koldun Clan Disciplines, therefore, are Auspex, Animalism, and either Dominate or Vicissitude (depending on whether the koldun is an Old Clan Tzimisce or not).</p><p><b>Weakness:</b> As with the rest of the Clan (p. 71): The koldun must rest in the proximity of at least two handfuls of native soil. Failure to meet this requirement halves the koldun\u2019s dice pools every 24 hours, until all pools fall to one die. This penalty remains until they are able to rest for a full day in their earth.</p><p class=ttlQuote><b>Quote:</b> <i>I am the land. You have not violated my home...you have violated me.

            "description": "<p>Achieving prominence during the Venetian Renaissance, the Giovanni family built their fortune on the rise of the middle class and the ready profit of banking and Mediterranean trade (and the criminal enterprise that came with it). However, with the family\u2019s rise came hubris, as its paterfamilias sought ever more power, and with that hubris came horror. With his earthly power at its apex, Augustus Giovanni turned to the arts of controlling the dead, and in doing so, gained the Embrace from a forgotten Antediluvian. With a conclave of conspirators, the Giovanni plunged a now-forgotten Clan into oblivion and built their own legacy on its corpse.</p><p>Since those first nights, the Giovanni have accepted no limits on their ambitions, despite opposition from Kindred outside their Clan and a well-deserved reputation as \u201cDevil Kindred.\u201d They studied forbidden arts, becoming formidable in the nigrimancy that allowed them power over the spirits of the departed, and degeneracy followed in the wake of unclean ritual. To this night, the Giovanni are known for the insular nature of their Clan and the incestuous practices by which they populate it. A few outside families and factions fall under Giovanni auspices, but the vast majority of the Clan comes from the debased mortal family. The family remains successful despite all of their ghastly peccadilloes, and has amassed a vast wealth through crime, politics, and the secrets of the dead that keeps them in their position of degraded opulence.</p><p>In public view, the Giovanni make a great show of humility and respect. Part of this gentility is a habit of centuries, still in place from when the other Clans hunted the usurping Necromancers (and to preserve their hard-won neutrality from the conflict between the Camarilla and the Sabbat). Another part of it is the velvet glove hiding the iron fist of their nature, remarkable for forcing ghosts, minds, and bodies alike to bow to their needs. To hear the Giovanni tell it, Princes and Archbishops alike owe them favors, and anyone with something to offer may earn their patronage.</p><p>For the most part, the Giovanni participate little in the Jyhad, pursuing their own agenda of cultivating wealth and building a foundation of power in the lands beyond the veil of death. Outsiders rarely comprehend the goals of the Necromancers, but only the most trusted of the Giovanni know that the Clan wants to plunge the world into a state where the dead and the living commingle. And with their mastery of Necromancy, the Giovanni would be positioned to rule it all.</p><p><b>Nickname:</b> Necromancers</p><p><b>Appearance:</b> Outwardly, Giovanni dress with subtlety and taste. Much of the Clan comes from the original mortal family, and have not only olive Italian complexions, but some amount of inherited family features. Those outside the immediate family often appear \u201cof a type,\u201d and in the traditional garb of their regional family branch.</p><p><b>Haven:</b> The family wealth of the Giovanni is evident in their havens, which may take the form of villas or lavish estates. The Necromancers often have valuables invested in their havens as well, such as galleries of fine art or displays of jewelry. Many Giovanni also maintain secondary havens, where they may have elaborate necromantic crypts or just flats where they can lie low if necessary.</p><p><b>Background:</b> Giovanni of the main family branch have usually spent some amount of time as a ghoul in a practice known as the Proxy Kiss. During this time, the Kindred-to-be learns about the treacherous and jealous reality of the vampire family. She learns ambition and an unhealthy dose of duplicity, in addition to the family history and customs. Giovanni rarely see much of the outside world on their own terms during the Proxy Kiss period, and often become insular and alienated, while at the same time eager to stand out among the other family ghouls.</p><p><b>Character Creation:</b> Giovanni vampires often have outgoing, professional Demeanors that hide unpleasant Natures warped in their upbringing. Social or Mental Attributes are usually primary, though some of the \u201csoldiers\u201d of the family prefer Physical Attributes. Emphasis likewise usually falls on primary Knowledges or Talents, depending on proclivity. A split in the Clan sees those who favor the practicality of Backgrounds (particularly those tied to wealth and exerting influence) diverge from those who prefer the forbidden puissance of Disciplines. Few Giovanni could be described as well-rounded.</p><p><b>Clan Disciplines:</b> Dominate, Necromancy, Potence</p><p><b>Weaknesses:</b> The Kiss of a Giovanni vampire causes excruciating pain in mortal vessels who receive it. If the Giovanni isn\u2019t careful, her vessel may die of shock and agony before being wholly exsanguinated.

For example, if a Giovanni takes one point of blood from a mortal vessel, that victim would suffer two health levels of damage. As a result, they tend to use blood banks and other means of feeding that don\u2019t fight as much.</p><p><b>Organization:</b> Like few other Clans, the Necromancers have a top-down organization where policy is made by a (presumed) still-active Clan progenitor, Augustus. The family maintains an enormous palazzo known as the Mausoleum in Venice, where elders and fledglings alike dance to the whims of their ancient puppetmasters. Clan structure is itself familial, with the added complications that degeneracy and vampirism offer. Incest, ancestor worship, necrophilia, cults of guilt, and bizarre relationships in which fathers and grandmothers are their own issue\u2019s childer make a mire of the Clan and family, and fracture many Giovanni long before they become Kindred.</p><div class=ttlStereo><h3>Stereotypes</h3><p><b>Assamite:</b> <i>Beware, as all the money in the world still cannot buy one passage back from the grave.</i></p><p><b>Brujah:</b> <i>Inexpensive allies or irascible enemies.</i></p><p><b>Followers of Set:</b> <i>Dangerous relics deluded by a primitive grasp of what lies beyond the Shroud.</i></p><p><b>Gangrel:</b> <i>Let them have their mud and misery.</i></p><p><b>Lasombra:</b> <i>Like us, they stand with one foot in the temporal world and one foot in the occult.</i></p><p><b>Malkavian:</b> <i>Once they crumble to dust, they don\u2019t have to suffer their madness anymore.</i></p><p><b>Nosferatu:</b> <i>Dead men do tell tales, and the Sewer Rats have so many tales to tell.</i></p><p><b>Ravnos:</b> <i>The Kindred have forever to make of their fates what they will, and this is how they spend it?</i></p><p><b>Toreador:</b> <i>How tragic is the Kindred so desperately afraid of what she truly is.</i></p><p><b>Tremere:</b> <i>We don\u2019t enshrine the history that made us what we are, so why do they?</i></p><p><b>Tzimisce:</b> <i>The worm that feasts on its own flesh must eventually starve.</i></p><p><b>Ventrue:</b> <i>They often forget that Machiavelli worked in the wake of the Borgias and the Medicis.</i></p><p><b>Caitiff:</b> <i>Without knowing their origins, what can they possibly amount to?</i></p><p><b>Camarilla and Sabbat:</b> <i>Let them have their endless war, for we grow rich by selling each side what it needs to continue the effort.</i></p><p><b>Anarchs:</b> <i>Until they build something of lasting import, they are the ugliest of the sisters.</i></p></div><p class=ttlQuote><b>Quote:</b> <i>You misunderstand the situation if you think you\u2019re important to me alive.</i></p>"

As their society fell, the Tlacique briefly allied with the Sabbat, but when the two factions took the time to examine the others, they found their belief systems quite incompatible.

            "description": "<p>Addiction, debasement, corruption, and desperation strike fear into many Kindred who worry that theirs will become an unlife of ruin, but to the Followers of Set, these and more are the tools of the trade. Pimps, pushers, and priests, the Setites cater to the needs of the desperate, and convert them to a nihilistic cause in doing so. Whether one needs flesh, money, drugs, or dark secrets, the Followers of Set can provide it, and when they do so, they all but guarantee themselves a return visit from those who seek them.</p><p>The Followers of Set are as much a chthonic religion as they are a Clan, though the faith includes the Clan. Its mythology is complex and convoluted, an impenetrable pantheon of god-monsters. At the apex of this worship stands a syncretism of the Egyptian Lord of the Underworld Set and the Greek hydra Typhon, as much spiritual guardians of secret places as they are the \u201cliberators\u201d of other\u2019s souls. To outsiders, this is all blasphemous religious affectation, but to devout Setites, the cult and cause are real, and their dark lord works his will through them.</p><p>Needless to say, the politics of desperation and the placation of evil gods place the Serpents on the outside of Kindred society. The Setites are fine with this. The Kindred can often find themselves in need of what the Followers of Set purvey, and the extra \u201cservice\u201d of secrecy is one the Setites are happy to provide \u2014 at a premium. The Setites offer a devil\u2019s deal, but on their own terms. That way, when they collect their due and feed blood and souls into the maw of the Typhonic beast, all of its sacrifices have been given willingly.</p><p><b>Nickname:</b> Setites, Serpents</p><p><b>Sect:</b> Externally, none of the Sects will have the Followers of Set. Internally, the Setites sometimes describe themselves in terms of both Sect and Clan. They have no real impetus to join either the Camarilla or Sabbat, and their goals are different from those of the Anarchs.</p><p><b>Appearance:</b> Many older Setites hail from the North African and Mediterranean ethnicities native to the Serpents\u2019 historical territory, but they freely Embrace from among the mortals of their adopted homes. Some long-standing Setite temples are tied to locations where \u201cEgyptian\u201d Serpents might seem out of place, but where some aspect of serpent mythology is present, as in Mesoamerica or even far-flung Nordic locales, and thus draw their membership from local populations. Red hair is considered a mark of Set\u2019s favor.</p><p><b>Haven:</b> Where their hidden temples stand, the Setites make their havens, either individually or communally. These may be anything from \u201cchurches\u201d with never-before-heard-of denominations or they may be outright cults that have to hide their existences. The secretive Serpents sometimes hide individual havens in places where other Kindred don\u2019t often go, such as insular ethnic neighborhoods, abandoned domains, \u201cthe rough part of town,\u201d and so forth. Some Setites also haven in secret mystical places that have value to the Clan, guarding them from outsiders.</p><p><b>Background:</b> Prospective childer for the Followers of Set often spend some time involved with a Setite cult, so they\u2019re indoctrinated in the mysteries of the Clan before becoming one of its Kindred. They may come from any cultural origin, though many are outsiders, loners, or otherwise marginalized by society, which is often what led them to the forbidden fruits offered by the cult of Set in the first place.</p><p><b>Character Creation:</b> Sires choose those who demonstrate acumen in Social and Mental Attributes, as the Clan needs its proselytizers and its priests to be charismatic and quick-witted. Knowledges are almost always primary, though Talents may be so instead, especially among those Serpents engaged in dealings with others. Setites focus on Backgrounds that give influence over others whether subtly or overtly, making Allies, Contacts, Influence, Resources, and sometimes Retainers popular.</p><p><b>Clan Disciplines:</b> Obfuscate, Presence, Serpentis</p><p><b>Weaknesses:</b> Given their origins in darkness, the Serpents react negatively to bright light: Add two health levels to damage caused by exposure to sunlight. Setites also lose one die from dice pools for actions taken in bright light (police spotlights, stage lights, flares, etc.).</p><p><b>Organization:</b> Setite organization is mostly local, with a single temple or network of cults representing a city\u2019s Serpent presence. Setites in the cities rarely scheme among each other, preferring to face outward threats in unity rather than the schismatic self-interest of the Sects. Whispers persist of a massive temple devoted to Set located somewhere in Africa, with a terrible Methuselah who claims to be the childe of Set himself at the head. If this is true, then the Clan\u2019s higher agenda probably originates here, but the Setites themselves remain silent on the topic.</p><div class=ttlStereo><h3>Stereotypes</h3><p><b>Assamite:</b> <i>They aren\u2019t so different from us, and it scares the hell out of them.</i></p><p><b>Brujah:</b> <i>We could have saved their precious Carthage, but in their pride, they chose an eternity of ridicule and failure.</i></p><p><b>Gangrel:</b> <i>Don\u2019t mistake their sullenness for noble savagery.

The Ventrue greatly value propriety and honor, and use many forms of address and respect \u2014 their Laws of Decorum are complex and rigid, and could fill several volumes.

            "description": "<p>The strange tale of the Ahrimanes begins with a Sabbat Gangrel <i>antitribu</i> named Muricia. Caught between two warring factions of Sabbat Gangrel, she watched as her packmates were pulled into the conflict and ultimately killed. She renounced the Sabbat and the Gangrel Clan entirely, now calling herself \u201can Ahrimane,\u201d and called upon shamanic magic to alter herself. How exactly this was accomplished is still a mystery. One theory is that Muricia was an anomaly even before she attempted her magical working, and had access to powers that other vampires didn\u2019t. Another (possibly more plausible) theory is that Muricia had help from mortal sorcerers who were hoping the effect would spread throughout the Kindred of the world, sterilizing them and preventing any new vampires from being created.</p><p>Regardless of the origin, Muricia found that she was not able to create childer or blood bonds. She did, however, retain the ability to turn other Kindred (at least other Gangrel) into whatever she had become. She kept the animalistic features that she can gained during her previous unlife, however, and it may have been her cat-like eyes that lent her bloodline its nickname.</p><p>Muricia extended the offer of \u201cbecoming Ahrimane\u201d to any female Gangrel who wished it. She made it quite clear she was not interested in performing the process on male Kindred, though the specific reasons for this remain unclear. A few Gangrel joined her, taking havens in the southern United States and avoid contacting with other Sabbat.</p><p>The Ahrimanes were never numerous, and although they remained nominally allied with the Sabbat, Muricia made it quite clear that they were to be left alone. This isolation may have doomed them, however. In the late 1990s, all contact with the Cats ceased. Investigators found, sometime later, that their havens were empty, and no one has heard from them since. Most Sabbat believe that the Ahrimanes were destroyed, but concede that it is possible that Muricia might have led her line on a spiritual pilgrimage somewhere out of the Kindred\u2019s reach.</p><p><b>Nickname:</b> Cats</p><p><b>Sect:</b> The Ahrimanes were an independent Sect, or more accurately, a group of independent individuals. They identified more with the Sabbat than the Camarilla, if only because they did not wish to answer to any elder (expect perhaps Muricia).</p><p><b>Appearance:</b> All Ahrimanes were female, and most were either of African American or Native American descent (Muricia, apparently, was not partial to Caucasian vampires). Most Ahrimanes never went anywhere unarmed, and dressed to fight. Many Ahrimanes had animal features left over from their time as Gangrel.</p><p><b>Haven:</b> Muricia was a vampire of some means, and she purchased houses on the outskirts of several cities in the American South (in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Georgia especially). New Ahrimanes could make their own arrangements or stay in one of these homes.</p><p><b>Background:</b> All Ahrimanes were Gangrel before their magical transformation. As such, their Backgrounds varied just as much as the Beasts\u2019. The sort of Gangrel who became an Ahrimane was female, usually non-white, and frustrated by the situation in her Sect or city.</p><p><b>Character Creation:</b> All Ahrimanes had at least three dots in Mentor, to represent Muricia\u2019s guidance. Combat Abilities and Physical Attributes were common, but this was as much from the Ahrimanes\u2019 Gangrel background as anything else. Likewise, a dot or two of Protean or Fortitude was common, since Ahrimanes began unlife as Gangrel.</p><p><b>Clan Disciplines:</b> Animalism, Presence, Spiritus</p><p><b>Weakness:</b> An Ahrimanes\u2019 blood was inert. They were unable to create childer or blood bonds, and a person consuming Ahrimane blood did not become a ghoul.</p><p><b>Organization:</b> Since all Ahrimanes effectively had the same \u201csire,\u201d they were all beholden to Muricia. She did not attempt to control or rule her creations, but did keep tabs on them and help them develop their powers of Spiritus. The bloodline was fairly tight-knit, as vampire \u201cfamilies\u201d go, and threatening one Ahrimane generally meant battling several.</p><div class=ttlStereo><h3>Stereotypes</h3><p><b>Camarilla:</b> <i>I would suffocate under their rule.</i></p><p><b>Sabbat:</b> <i>Let them think they run us.

Once she re-entered her territory, her dice pools returned to normal within a few hours.",
            "description": "<p>The Lhiannan boasted a strange creation story. They claimed that their founder \u2014 a vampire simply known as the Crone \u2014 became bonded with a spirit of the forests. This spirit was a desperate, jealous being that could apparently see that people would destroy the forests and burn the trees that comprised them. Joining with an undying predator, then, was apparently the spirit\u2019s attempt at dodging this fate. Whether or not any of that is true, the Lhiannan did have a connection to the natural world that no other vampire, not even the Gangrel, can equal.</p><p>Whenever a Lhiannan Embraced, a shard of that original spirit broke off and empowered the new Cainite. This spirit-shard allowed Lhiannan to use their Ogham Discipline, which, in turn, enabled the style of unlife that the Lhiannan enjoyed. It also made the Lhiannan territorial above all else, and the Druids were quite limited in their mobility. The Lhiannan, much like the Telyavelic Tremere (see p. 438) found common cause with the pagan peoples of Europe. This, unfortunately, put them into conflict with Cainites and mortals who followed the Christian faith.</p><p>The bloodline was never numerous (especially since creating a new Lhiannan meant that the sire grew weaker), but the fires of the Inquisition and the spread of the Christian religion took a harsh toll on the Druids. By the end of the 14th century, they had all been destroyed. In modern times, though, Gangrel trade rumors of powerful Kindred in European forests decorated with strange, bloody symbols, so perhaps some of them survived \u2014 or perhaps the forest spirit that initially created the bloodline has resurfaced.</p><p><b>Nickname:</b> Druids</p><p><b>Sect:</b> The Lhiannan did not survive to see the dawning of the Sabbat or the Camarilla. In historical nomenclature, they were decidedly on the Low Clan side of the social divide, and most Cainites probably wouldn\u2019t have known them from the Gangrel. Lhiannan rarely joined coteries, limited as they were in mobility.</p><p><b>Appearance:</b> The Druids resembled the native people of the regions of Europe that they called home \u2014 the British Isles, for the most part.</p><p><b>Haven:</b> The Lhiannan made their havens in the forests of Europe, constructing simple dwellings or finding natural shelter. They would sometimes find a man-made haven and kill or enslave the inhabitants, or very rarely eke out an existence on the periphery of human civilization by taking the role of a shaman or wise woman.</p><p><b>Background:</b> Since performing the Embrace meant growing weaker, the Druids only created childer out of sheer loneliness or when they found someone who truly impressed them. A pagan spirit-speaker with real devotion to her craft, or a woodsman with impeccable respect for the forests might be enough to get a Lhiannan\u2019s attention. The Lhiannan refused to Embrace Christians, Jews, or Muslims.</p><p><b>Character Creation:</b> All Lhiannan were capable of surviving in the wilderness, and so Physical Attributes, Skills, and Talents were important. A Lhiannan acting as a counsel to a mortal settlement was likely to have higher Social Attributes and appropriate Abilities. Herd and Retainers (animals) were common Backgrounds.</p><p><b>Clan Disciplines:</b> Animalism, Ogham, Presence</p><p><b>Weakness:</b> The Lhiannan were part nature spirit, and the mark of their inhumanity ran strong within them. All difficulties to detect their nature via Auspex were reduced by two, and even normal humans felt vaguely uncomfortable in their presence. Additionally, any Lhiannan who left her territory became agitated \u2014 all dice pools were reduced by one die per week (to a minimum of the character\u2019s Stamina) that she was gone. Once she re-entered her territory, her dice pools returned to normal within a few hours.</p><p><b>Organization:</b> Once a Lhiannan Embraced a childe, she generally kept the new vampire around for a few years until that childe was ready to fend for himself (and the novelty of having someone else around wore off). The sire would then send the childe away to find his own haven and territory. The Lhiannan were generally aware of members of their bloodline whose territories were adjacent, but there was no system of communication in place. This, of course, may have contributed to their eventual destruction.</p><div class=ttlStereo><h3>Stereotypes</h3><p><b>High Clans:</b> <i>No one who wears such heavy, false robes or who shies away from blood is a leader to me.</i></p><p><b>Low Clans:</b> <i>By accepting the title of \u201clow,\u201d they show it to be accurate.</i></p></div><div class=ttlStereo><h3>The View From Without</h3><p><b>High Clans:</b> <i>Watch, my childe.

            "description": "<p>In nights long lost to the passage of time, the Tremere existed, though they were <i>something else</i>. Those early Tremere then made a bargain \u2014 or wrought a spell, or any number of other harrowing methods attributed to the Clan \u2014 that changed them from what they had been into the vampires they are tonight. Some claim they stole the Curse of Caine from a torpid Antediluvian, or that they concocted the flawed immortality of the Kindred from the stolen vitae of other vampires. Such mysterious origins, which some describe as treacherous or even blasphemous, haunt the Tremere, as the other Clans look upon them with mistrust and suspicion. The history \u2014 and, indeed, the modern legacy \u2014 of the Tremere is one marked by Clan war, centuries-old grudges, and the stain of unwholesome mysteries long left unsolved.</p><p>Tonight, Clan Tremere is a Clan shaped by its practice of blood sorcery. A flexible Discipline, Thaumaturgy is heavily entrenched within the Tremere, and they maintain cultic havens known as chantries to study its uses and share secrets among each other. To the Tremere, blood is both sustenance and the source of mystical power; they gather in their witch-houses to further their understanding of the vitae that is such a focal point of their unlives.</p><p>Beyond the practice of Thaumaturgy itself, the Warlocks are known for their close-knit hierarchy. They hail from the Old World, with an established power base in Vienna to which all members of the Clan answer to some degree. Although they may be one of the youngest Clans \u2014 in the terms with which deathless creatures like vampires measure time \u2014 they are as adept at the Jyhad as any Kindred. Beset by enemies who call them usurpers and backed by allies who may or may not defend the alliances they force, the Tremere have evolved to be self-sufficient. Indeed, many who eye them warily think they possess too great an edge, with their flexible Discipline and protective Clan and chantry structure, and move against them both secretly and overtly.</p><p><b>Nickname:</b> Warlocks</p><p><b>Sect:</b> Clan Tremere considers itself one of the pillars of the Camarilla. It is rumored that they once performed a ritual that all but eradicated those of the Clan not loyal to the Ivory Tower (and thus the Tremere\u2019s pyramidal hierarchy).</p><p><b>Appearance:</b> Tremere often have two distinct presentations: a traditional and severe public aspect and a much more eldritch mien better suited to wielding their blood sorceries. When out in public or at Kindred events, the Tremere favor conservative suits and dresses and muted tones. When in their chantries or convening with others of their Clan, they often prefer robes decorated with subtle occult symbols or garb with various folds and pockets for their bizarre ritual ingredients.</p><p><b>Haven:</b> Many Tremere rely on a central chantry the Clan maintains in cities where it has a notable presence. More solitary Warlocks develop private havens, with all of the trappings one might expect from an occult scholar, from libraries to alchemical laboratories to moonlit balcony observatories and even more sinister oubliettes where vivisected \u201cresearch subjects\u201d bleed according to experimental Tremere-controlled stimuli.</p><p><b>Background:</b> The Tremere draw from a fairly narrow pool of potential acolytes. Those who have an awareness of the supernatural, who are driven to succeed, who seek answers that elude less inquisitive individuals, yet who also have the discipline to heed the edicts of the hierarchy make good Tremere. This isn\u2019t to say that individualists don\u2019t have room in the Clan; rather, those who go their own way may well find themselves leading a chantry \u2014 or greeting the sun if their interests don\u2019t align with those of the pyramid.</p><p><b>Character Creation:</b> Mental Attributes and Knowledges are prominent among the Tremere. Many have high Courage and Willpower, but are somewhat lacking in Conscience or Conviction. They often favor Backgrounds that heighten their relationship to the Clan, like Mentor, Status, and Retainers (whom an accomplished Warlock may craft from otherwise inert components).</p><p><b>Clan Disciplines:</b> Auspex, Dominate, Thaumaturgy</p><p><b>Weaknesses:</b> Tremere dependency on blood is even more pronounced than that of other Kindred. It takes only two draughts of another vampire\u2019s blood for a Tremere to become blood bound instead of the normal three \u2014 the first drink counts as if the Tremere had taken two drinks.

The elders of the Clan are well aware of this, and seek to impart loyalty to the Clan by forcing all neonate Warlocks to drink of the (transubstantiated) blood of the seven Tremere elders soon after their Embrace.</p><p><b>Organization:</b> The hallmark of Clan Tremere is \u201cthe pyramid,\u201d the rigid hierarchy that governs the Clan and makes it the most organized of all the Kindred lineages. With many levels of membership, internal factions, and circles of mystery, the Tremere hierarchy presents a unified face to those outside the Clan, and is almost as unified behind the scenes. Still, the pyramid inculcates more than its share of paranoia, as both Warlocks and a competitive environment of academic occultism pits each acolyte against her peers to the greater accomplishment of the Clan.</p><div class=ttlStereo><h3>Stereotypes</h3><p><b>Assamite:</b> <i>They show signs of being able to subvert our rituals, so the time to tolerate them has expired.</i></p><p><b>Brujah:</b> <i>Hubris and a lack of self-discipline have laid low the Clan of warrior-poets.</i></p><p><b>Followers of Set:</b> <i>We pursue the secrets of the world and they pursue the secrets in its dark places.

Upon the Embrace, every Malkavian is afflicted with an insurmountable insanity that fractures her outlook for every night thereafter, making her unlife one of madness. Some consider this a form of oracular insight, while others simply consider them dangerous.</p><p>Make no mistake: Malkavian insanity is a painful, alienating phenomenon, but it occasionally provides the Lunatics with bursts of insight or heretofore unknown perspective. Madness for the Malkavians may take the form of any clinical form of insanity, or it may be a hyperacuity of senses others don\u2019t know they have; a supernatural puppeteer pulling the Malkavian\u2019s strings, or a sense that the Malkavian is somehow ahead of evolutionary schedule. A Malkavian may believe herself to be an idea given physical form or an avatar of some concept the World of Darkness has yet to encounter. She may be a nonstop ravening psychopath, or may be a mostly lucid individual sometimes rendered catatonic by fear of an impending cosmic cataclysm.</p><p>Their precarious stability makes it hard for other Kindred (or, indeed, any vessels with whom they may meet) to interact with Malkavians. The Clan sometimes indulges in elaborate, terrifying, and dangerous \u201cpranks\u201d which do little to endear them to other vampires. These incidents are nominally meant to educate the target, but the lesson can often be lost between the vampire\u2019s scramble for safety and the inability to parse the Malkavian\u2019s inner logic. Common pranks might be to replace a vain Toreador\u2019s haven door with a guillotine or to redistribute a Brujah elder\u2019s wealth while he\u2019s at Elysium, or it might take the form of giving a hunter the location where the Nosferatu gather. Kindred both dread and resent the word \u201cprank\u201d almost as much as they do the Lunatics themselves.</p><p><b>Nickname:</b> Lunatics</p><p><b>Sect:</b> In their moments of lucidity, the Malkavians offer their unorthodox perspectives and Devil\u2019s advocacy to the Camarilla, offering their visions and unique insights to cut through the webs of deceit. Princes and Primogen tolerate the Lunatics to varying degrees, but the Clan as a whole has always been a supporter of the Ivory Tower.</p><p><b>Appearance:</b> While Malkavians can come from any culture, the madness following the Embrace tends to lead them to extremes of self-presentation. Malkavians may appear disheveled, injured, or simply dirty. They could still be wearing the same clothes from the night of their Embrace or they may have stolen clothes from a laundromat or a department store during a fit of confusion or fugue. Of course, Malkavians are just as likely to be meticulous and exacting in their appearance, trying obsessively to appear as normal as possible.</p><p><b>Haven:</b> Consistency is rare among Malkavians. Quite simply, they establish havens where they think to, where they can, and where they can recall. A significant number of Malkavians have literally no home, spending each night where exhaustion or the sun\u2019s rays leave them. Others may permanently have the presidential suite in a posh hotel, a squat in the Barrens, the dispensary at a county jail, or a broom closet in a historical landmark.</p><p><b>Background:</b> Malkavians Embrace with all the caprice one would assume from them. Lunatic childer come from all economic and cultural strata, though most have some sort of hard-luck story or black secret behind them that caused their sire to take note. Truly damaged Malkavians who are unaware of the meanings of their actions may not even be aware that they have sired childer, which makes for very difficult entry into Kindred society for these castoffs, many of whom end up among the Caitiff.</p><p><b>Character Creation:</b> Loner, outsider, and deviant concepts and archetypes prevail among the Malkavians, as do Mental Attributes (with an occasional Social-primary madman or Physical-primary maniac hiding among the ranks). Talents and Knowledges are likely most popular among Malkavians. Backgrounds tend to be either broad and shallow or few and deep, representing the way the way the Malkavian caroms through unlife. Virtues, Humanity, and Paths often tumble quickly, usually in the wake of Willpower doing the same.</p><p><b>Clan Disciplines:</b> Auspex, Dementation, Obfuscate</p><p><b>Weaknesses:</b> All members of Clan Malkavian suffer from a permanent, incurable derangement. They may acquire and recover from other derangements, and may spend Willpower to ameliorate the effects of the derangement for a scene, but they can never recover from their original derangement.</p><p><b>Organization:</b> Rumor is more widespread than truth with regard to Malkavian organization, and any number of harrowing tales describe the function of the Clan. Some say the Lunatics all share a hive consciousness; others claim that this is in fact the lingering consciousness of the Clan\u2019s progenitor Malkav. Still others claim that a network of madness puts all Malkavians in contact with one another and is the cause of their crippling insanity. If nothing else, the Malkavians prove inscrutable and uncanny. One night, each of them frenzies when they see one another, while the next night, they all converge at the same time at the Sheriff\u2019s haven and accuse him of harboring Sabbat spies.

            "description": "<p>The Blood Brothers are Kindred only in a very loose sense. They are Sabbat shock troops, created by Tremere and Tzimisce sorcerers in order for the Sword of Caine to have loyal soldiers that can still pass for human. The process of creation (for the Blood Brothers do not undergo an Embrace) washes away any individuality and personality, leaving only strong, savage, and near-mindless quasi-vampires.</p><p>Blood Brothers are usually created in small groups of three to 10. These groups \u2014 called \u201ccircles\u201d \u2014 become family units connected by a kind of hive mind. The Sabbat also usually arranges for a Tzimisce to fleshcraft the circle\u2019s faces so that they are identical.</p><p>The Frankensteins are a secret weapon for the Sabbat for several reasons. The Sabbat finds that while the loyalty of the Blood Brothers is beyond reproach, they don\u2019t possess much in the way of creativity. They aren\u2019t capable of trickery, clever tactics, or improvisation, and unless another vampire can direct them in the field in real time (which isn\u2019t impossible, given modern communication technology), they aren\u2019t good for much beyond simple, direct missions. Second, they are difficult and risky to create. Creating a circle of Blood Brothers means killing half a dozen people. While the Sabbat doesn\u2019t have a problem with that in itself, a pattern of disappearances can clue in mortal authorities and Camarilla watchers alike that the Sword of Caine is up to something.</p><p>Finally, the Blood Brothers are more useful as a surprise attack, and survivors of those attacks run the risk of passing along knowledge of the Brothers\u2019 weaknesses. Creating too many, even if it were possible or practical, would mean that eventually some Camarilla Tremere would figure out how to hurt them, or even how to reverse the magic that keeps them mindless, loyal, and useful.

As long as the circle is allowed to stay together, they don\u2019t seem to care much about amenities.</p><p><b>Background:</b> A Blood Brother\u2019s mortal life is irrelevant. All that a person needs to do to become a Blood Brother is cross the wrong vampire\u2019s path on the wrong night. The Sabbat kills the target, removes his body hair, smooths over his features, and places him with four or five others, and after that no trace of the man-that-was remains.</p><p><b>Character Creation:</b> Blood Brothers prioritize Physical Attributes and Talents.

Everything is fraught with wonder and terror, low politics and sensual glories, the profound and the profane, and an undeniable undercurrent of the sanguinary. These Kindred are the Toreador, and they spend unlives ensconced in pleasure.</p><p>Of course, for vampires of this disposition, it\u2019s easy to become jaded and bitter. More than the other Clans, Toreador often succumb to ennui, or fight the eventual boredom of unchanging immortality by playing at rivalries. An excess of stimulation turns them into slaves to the sensations they seek. The most debased Toreador can become true monsters, sinking to unimaginable levels of depravity in order to feel anything at all.</p><p>The Kindred of Clan Toreador often involve themselves greatly in the world of mortals. They have any number of reasons, whether enjoying proximity to the blush of life, cultivating veritable cults of doting followers, or influencing and following the trends that their own kind simultaneously mock and venerate. To hear the Toreador tell it, they are the Muses of a desperate mortal world, inspiring through their beauty or patronage.</p><p>Toreador culture is a mixture of sybarites, dilettantes, and visionaries. Some Toreador, with echoes of mortal passion, Embrace lovers or \u201cproject\u201d progeny who seem to fly in the face of every Toreador custom. These either don\u2019t last long or rise to great prominence as subversives and individualists. Ideas, trends, and \u201cthe next great thing\u201d spread through the Clan, and other Kindred often look to the Toreador to guide them. The Degenerates know this, and many become Harpies, Princes, and other key figures in vampiric society.</p><p><b>Nickname:</b> Degenerates</p><p><b>Sect:</b> The Camarilla would not have survived in the nights following the Anarch Revolt without substantial participation from the Toreador, and they remain among its most ardent supporters.</p><p><b>Appearance:</b> Almost to the last, they are attractive in some way, whether the traditional beauty of a runway model or the dangerous allure of something more predatory. The Degenerates augment their physical beauty with a sense of personal style, which may take the form of expensive couture, avant-garde street wear, or classical fashions designed to emphasize their appealing qualities. This isn\u2019t to say that ugly Toreador don\u2019t exist. Indeed, those gifted with less physical beauty often go that much further with their choice of accoutrements.</p><p><b>Haven:</b> The Degenerates spare no expense in appointing their havens in luxury, often with many original works of art. It is a point of pride among Toreador to have an unconventional (and thus memorable) haven with modern comforts; thus, many have striking lofts and penthouses, while the bolder among them renovate or repurpose everything from abandoned aquariums or deconsecrated churches to rooftop gardens or converted warehouse-galleries in fashion-forward neighborhoods. Share a communal haven? How d\u00e9class\u00e9.</p><p><b>Background:</b> Many Toreador hail from high-society or \u201cbohemian\u201d backgrounds. Indeed, many are themselves artists or influential among local art scenes or other subcultures. Actors, singers, musicians, sculptors, poets, playwrights, authors, and creative folk of any stripe may well find a home in the Clan, as do those who serve as patrons to (or travel in the entourages of) those artistic types.</p><p><b>Character Creation:</b> Social attributes are almost always primary, with an even split among Talents, Skills, and Knowledges depending on how the Toreador distinguishes herself. Toreador also love to cultivate Backgrounds. Allies, Contacts, Resources, Domain, Haven, Mentors, Resources, Retainers \u2014 all of these have great value among Toreador. Wise Toreador may choose to develop their Virtues, Humanity, Path, or Willpower, because with an unlife of degeneracy, they must frequently attend to the ugly business of bringing the Beast to heel.</p><p><b>Clan Disciplines:</b> Auspex, Celerity, Presence</p><p><b>Weaknesses:</b> When a Toreador experiences something truly remarkable \u2014 a person, an objet d\u2019art, a lovely sunrise \u2014 the player must make a Self-Control or Instinct roll (difficulty 6).

Certain Toreador (and a few outside the Clan) sometimes use the terms \u201cartiste\u201d and \u201cposeur\u201d when describing individual Toreador, often derisively, to describe whether the Degenerate in question is one who is seen as creative or simply a follower of established trends, but these are certainly informal distinctions.</p><div class=ttlStereo><h3>Stereotypes</h3><p><b>Assamite:</b> <i>Blood-soaked barbarians.</i></p><p><b>Brujah:</b> <i>A fire may be stoked, but if left unattended, it may destroy what it once warmed.</i></p><p><b>Followers of Set:</b> <i>Worms breed in their vile footprints.</i></p><p><b>Gangrel:</b> <i>Beauty and the Beast, only without the complication of Beauty.

Knowledgeable vampires are aware that the Followers of Set claim descent from an Antediluvian who took his name from that Egyptian serpent-god (though the Setites certainly seem to think Set actually was the god). If that\u2019s the case, such Kindred wonder, who was Osiris? A mortal spellcaster that was Embraced? Set\u2019s childe? Or perhaps another Antediluvian, lost to time and destroyed millennia ago?</p><p>Whatever the truth about Set, there was once a powerful vampire called Osiris. He was a philosopher and a scholar in an Egyptian court (whose dynasty is unknown), Embraced by an unknown vampire who believed that his knowledge of the law would make him a useful ally in the battle to bring Egypt under Kindred influence. Osiris, however, was horrified by his new condition. Rather than meet the sun, though, he became determined to face and banish his personal demons, and especially his own Beast. His studies on sublimating the vampiric impulses may have helped form the basis for the search for Golconda. At the very least, they expanded it.</p><p>The Children of Osiris might have become a Clan and continued into the modern nights, but Set slew Osiris. As mortal legendry has it, Set dismembered his \u201cbrother\u201d and scattered his body throughout the land of Egypt. His sister, Isis (perhaps another vampire, but no one still extant seems to know for sure) found the pieces and reassembled them, and impossibly, Osiris was resurrected. Death, however, had taken its toll. His blood was inert, and he could no longer create more childer. This, however, did not stop him from spreading his path.</p><p><b>Nickname:</b> Since even the Kindred who know about the Children of Osiris assume them all to be dead, they do not have a common nickname.</p><p><b>Sect:</b> Strictly speaking, the Children of Osiris are a Sect, rather than a bloodline. They do not (and, by virtue of their own laws, cannot) join the Sabbat or the Camarilla.</p><p><b>Appearance:</b> Since the Children can hail from any Clan or bloodline, their appearance can vary widely. They all shave their heads every evening upon awakening, and when in their temples they wear white robes adorned with mystical symbols and hieroglyphs. When leaving their temples on business, they dress simply and stay inconspicuous.</p><p><b>Haven:</b> The few remaining Children of Osiris in the world dwell in one of several temples. These temples are well-hidden and kept secret from other Kindred, meaning that they tend to be in areas that don\u2019t boast much of a vampire population.</p><p><b>Background:</b> Children of Osiris renounce their Clans because they hate their condition, but do not wish to commit suicide. The search for Golconda leads some Kindred to the Children, while others encounter the Sect after running afoul of the Followers of Set.</p><p><b>Character Creation:</b> Children of Osiris can be from any Clan (except the Followers of Set; while the Children might be willing to accept a truly repentant Setite, the situation has never come up). The character can have any combination of Attributes and Abilities, and they retain whatever knowledge of Disciplines they had before joining.

Dobrul, a wanderer with great respect for the Mongol hordes, Embraced several of their warriors. These vampires became the spirit warriors of the steppe, following the nomadic Mongol tribes and protecting them from outward threats.</p><p>The Anda had intricate rites governing the Embrace of new Kindred. Once a candidate was selected, any Anda in the area met for a discussion on that candidate\u2019s qualities. The prospective Tartar had to be an impressive warrior, but tempered enough in nature to understand that only by protecting his tribe from outward supernatural threats could he keep it healthy enough to feed from. Once the decision was made, the prospective sire would wash the candidate in a river, a ritual funerary bathing in the Mongol tradition. He would then drain and Embrace the new vampire.</p><p>This kind of ritual and observance governed much of the Anda\u2019s existence. Long and lonely nights wandering the steppe, either with the Mongols or alone (and they did wander alone, sometimes even into Western Europe), the Anda\u2019s Beast was the only company. Small wonder that these Kindred viewed themselves as spiritual warriors, their brutal ethos the only bulwark against madness and depredation.</p><p>The Anda made war against a variety of foes. They would join their nomad tribes against whatever enemies they chose (as far as they could, since not all battles were fought at night). They also clashed with native Chinese shapeshifters and vampires, and it was this latter group that proved the undoing of the Anda in the 14th century. The bloodline\u2019s heyday was the reign of Kublai Khan, and during this time they could be found openly celebrating their undead nature in China.

The skin of an Anda faded to an odd brown-yellow following the Embrace.</p><p><b>Haven:</b> The Anda dwelled on the steppe, far enough away from their yasun to avoid discovery, but close enough to catch up with them when night fell. The truly monstrous or depraved among them did not protect a tribe, but led a solitary unlife, feeding as opportunity permitted. These poor souls typically fell to torpor from hunger, and if any Anda still exist, it is likely one of these horrors, sleeping buried in somewhere in China.</p><p><b>Background:</b> The Anda did not Embrace capriciously. They chose their candidates carefully, since this choice made a statement about who would protect their people.

It was also said that he grew progressively more disgusted with Kindred affairs over time, and weary of the constant, bloody cycles of violence and betrayal. He left his home for lands far to the east. When he returned, he was changed. He was tranquil and contemplative, but also somewhat fatalistic. Most surprisingly, though, he had developed a third eye in his forehead. Saulot Embraced new childer, and his Clan slowly split into two distinct lines \u2014 the \u201cwarrior\u201d and \u201chealer\u201d Salubri. For centuries, they acted as advisors, bodyguards, and sages to other Kindred and, to a lesser extent, mortals.</p><p>And then came the diablerie of Saulot.</p><p>The mages of the newly created Tremere line found Saulot\u2019s torpid body, and drained his blood and soul. They usurped the power of the one of the Clans of Caine, and sent the Salubri into a downward spiral from which they never really recovered. Tonight, rumor has it that only seven members of the once-respected line exist at any given time.</p><p>The rumors die hard, however. Modern Kindred know of the Salubri as diablerists who consume their own sires (and do it openly \u2014 patricide is hardly unknown among the other Clans, but they don\u2019t admit to it) and remove the souls of other Kindred. The Soulsuckers are, supposedly, a Clan of defilers and liars from centuries past, possibly involved with demon worship, and demonstrably part of the Sabbat (see Salubri <i>antitribu</i>, p. 431). They ask, quite reasonably, how the Salubri are able to achieve Golconda with any regularity. They wonder how any line can sustain itself with so few members. And, finally, they pose this question: even if these first two notions are taken as given, why would the Salubri need to submit to diablerie? Why do their childer need to consume their sires\u2019 souls, if not for some defect in the bloodline itself?</p><p><b>Nickname:</b> Cyclops, or, less kindly, Soulsuckers</p><p><b>Sect:</b> The Salubri are independent, though they do sometimes masquerade as other Clans and blend in with the Camarilla. The Salubri, however, are just trying to survive long enough to reach Golconda and pass along their blood. Sectarian politics mean nothing to them.</p><p><b>Appearance:</b> Each Salubri has a third eye in the center of their forehead. Otherwise, the Salubri are too few in number for any generalization about their appearances to be possible. Their ranks in modern nights have included children, the elderly, and adults of all races.</p><p><b>Haven:</b> Salubri are unwelcome in most cities, and that means their havens are situated in isolated environments. They also usually have multiple escape routes, and only have what possessions the character can carry in a backpack. Quick departures are not uncommon for the members of this bloodline, so Salubri don\u2019t get attached to their havens.</p><p><b>Background:</b> The Salubri Embrace people whom they feel can find Golconda.

            "description": "<p>The Harbingers of Skulls are a small bloodline that emerged from the mists of the past and threw their lot in with the Sabbat. The Harbingers are alleged to all be elders, and frighteningly powerful. While their sudden appearance suggests a long bout of torpor, they don\u2019t behave like recently-awakened vampires. Indeed, they claim they have been dead these past five centuries.</p><p>The Harbingers of Skulls resemble rotting corpses, much like the Samedi. Indeed, vampires that know of both bloodlines suggest a common origin, but since neither the Samedi nor the Harbingers discuss their origins publically, it\u2019s just speculation.</p><p>The Harbingers have only been members of the Sabbat for a short time, but during that time they have made themselves invaluable. The Sword of Caine, lacking Giovanni members, has difficulty dealing with ghosts. This can lead to problematic hauntings, since the Sabbat kills enough people that ghostly visitation can become an issue. The Harbingers can exorcises these vengeful shades, or, better yet, turn them into incorporeal spies and slaves. And for all of this, the Harbingers ask nothing except for favors to be repaid at a later date.</p><p>The Sabbat, for its part, isn\u2019t usually given to the favor-trading that one finds in the Camarilla, but what the Harbingers bring to the table is too valuable to miss. And besides, whether one believes the fairy tale about noble origins and \u201crevenge on the traitorous moneylenders\u201d that the Harbingers sometimes spin, their passion is palpable. That kind of murderous zeal is always welcome in the Sword of Caine.</p><p><b>Nickname:</b> Lazarenes</p><p><b>Sect:</b> The Harbingers of Skulls belong entirely to the Sabbat. That said, given that the bloodline obviously has many secrets buried, it\u2019s impossible to know if any Lazarenes claim membership in the Camarilla or remain independent.</p><p><b>Appearance:</b> The Harbingers prefer to stay hidden in their havens, or at least remain among Kindred, and for good reason. They resemble emaciated, shrunken corpses. Their skin grows taut and white, and the gums recede, giving the impression of a bleached, grinning skull. Most Harbingers wearing flowing garments or burial shrouds, the better to highlight their affinity for death.</p><p><b>Haven:</b> Unlike most Sabbat Kindred, the Harbingers of Skulls do not join packs, and therefore do not use communal havens. They usually choose lairs away from mortal interference, but close enough to the living that they don\u2019t want for blood (or fresh corpses for their horrific arts). Crypts, disused laboratories, and slaughterhouses are common choices.</p><p><b>Background:</b> The background of a \u201ctypical\u201d Harbinger is impossible to know. They are all elders, and who they were in life has been lost to time. They do seem to show evidence of a classical education, and one survivor of a battle between a Harbinger and a gang of Camarilla Brujah mentions that the Lazarene used a style of fighting that originated in Florence. Beyond those sparse clues, however, the Harbingers\u2019 true identities are unknown.</p><p><b>Character Creation:</b> The Harbingers of Skulls tend toward morbid and somewhat violent concepts. They are obsessed with revenge, death, and the horrors beyond the grave. Social Attributes and Abilities aren\u2019t a priority. Mental Attributes and Knowledges are generally highly rated, but their status as elders means that they are formidable across the board (and imply a significant amount spent on the Generation Background to boot).</p><p><b>Clan Disciplines:</b> Auspex, Fortitude, Necromancy</p><p><b>Weakness:</b> No matter how much blood a Harbinger consumes, her skin remains deathly pale. Moreover, all Harbingers look like shriveled corpses. They have Appearance ratings of 0 and automatically fail Appearance rolls.</p><p><b>Organization:</b> The Harbingers have some kind of internal organization, and they do keep in contact and even meet with one another occasionally. They keep in touch using ghostly messengers, and they travel to meet each other using methods that other Kindred cannot match. Most of the Sabbat doesn\u2019t quite know how many Harbingers exist or what they might be doing.</p><div class=ttlStereo><h3>Stereotypes</h3><p><b>Camarilla:</b> <i>The more things change....</i></p><p><b>Sabbat:</b> <i>They can\u2019t win.

            "description": "<p>The Tremere unveiled the Gargoyle bloodline in AD 1167, and the Slaves have been a steady, if infrequent, part of Kindred society ever since. Gargoyles might, in fact, be one reason that the Tremere weren\u2019t exterminated entirely in their first few centuries of existence. These odd quasi-Kindred often look like their stone namesakes \u2014 rocky-skinned, ugly, winged creatures that exist only to serve their masters.</p><p>Or such was the case for several hundred years. Recently, though, many of the Slaves have thrown off their chains and joined the Camarilla. Why the Gargoyles choose to ally themselves with the Sect that also protects their former masters is anyone\u2019s guess. One of the going theories is that it\u2019s a slap in the Warlocks\u2019 collective face, but most Kindred don\u2019t give the Gargoyles credit for being that sophisticated. More likely, the Rockheads simply realize that in the Camarilla, their talents will be recognized and no one will try and order them around (at least not directly).</p><p>Gargoyles are created out of other Kindred, and this ugly fact makes their creation a seldom-discussed topic in polite vampiric society. The Tremere start with a Gangrel, Nosferatu, or Tzimisce vampire and perform obscene, bloody rituals using its blood, heart, and skin. Vitae from another vampire (from one of the other two Clans) is used to provoke a violent mutation, with the result that some Gargoyles look purely hideous (Nosferatu base), some look feral (Gangrel base), and some look fleshy and sport bony protrusions (Tzimisce base). No Gargoyle can pass for human.</p><p>The Tremere tolerate the Gargoyles\u2019 presence in the Camarilla as best they can \u2014 it\u2019s not as though they can easily re-enslave them, after all. But relations are obviously strained. The Gargoyles\u2019 revolt and induction into the Camarilla has all but doomed the remaining slave Gargoyles, as their masters now monitor them ruthlessly for any sign of betrayal. The Tremere also aren\u2019t above planting hypnotic suggestions in their Slaves\u2019 minds, so that if they ever do rebel, they still serve a function for the Clan.</p><p><b>Nickname:</b> Traditionally Slaves, though free Gargoyles have been known to crack heads over it. Other common nicknames are Rockheads, Runaways, Freemen, and Grotesques.</p><p><b>Sect:</b> Gargoyles usually join the Camarilla. It\u2019s not impossible for a Slave to join the Sabbat, but the bloodline as a whole frowns on this.</p><p><b>Appearance:</b> Not all Gargoyles look like the stone grotesques found spitting rainwater over old buildings, but all are nightmarish. Some have tufts of hair protruding randomly over their bodies, or odd, galloping walks. Most Gargoyles have gray, rock-like skin. All Gargoyles have wings. These grow as the character\u2019s Flight (see p. 447) increases.</p><p><b>Haven:</b> Slave Gargoyles sleep wherever their masters allow them \u2014 closets, basements, crypts, cells. Free Gargoyles prefer sleeping in havens high above the ground. Bell towers and disused high-rises are favorites. Gargoyles are often muscle for other Kindred, sometimes in exchange for a bare-bones haven.</p><p><b>Background:</b> Gargoyles creation rarely shows a discernible pattern. The Change tortures the new Gargoyle\u2019s body, as bones elongate and split to form the wings. The face warps, leaving nothing to recognize the mortal or vampire by. They rarely remember their unlife or mortal existence.</p><p><b>Character Creation:</b> Created to be slaves, Gargoyles specialize in Physical Attributes, Talents, and a few select Skills (Melee, for instance). All Gargoyles start with a free dot of the Flight Discipline. Appearance is always zero. Gargoyles created by the Tremere are at the same Generation as the Kindred that act as their \u201cbase.\u201d</p><p><b>Clan Disciplines:</b> Flight, Fortitude, Potence, Visceratika</p><p><b>Weakness:</b> The Slaves are hideous. That grotesquery takes different forms, but always results in an Appearance of zero. They are also highly susceptible to mind control from any source. A Gargoyle\u2019s Willpower score (current or permanent) is considered two points lower when used to resist such powers.</p><p><b>Organization:</b> Gargoyles have a strong sense of community. They often keep communal havens. Sometimes Gargoyles petition the Prince for the release of slave Gargoyles, but more often they just tear slave owners to pieces. With no community, Gargoyles arelikely to Embrace and build their own.</p><div class=ttlStereo><h3>Stereotypes</h3><p><b>Camarilla:</b> <i>Our new home.

Still others are so terrified or revolted by the Nosferatu that these warped Kindred have little social interaction at all.</p><p>To their credit, the Nosferatu come to possess many of the whispered secrets of their reluctant fellows. The Sewer Rats enjoy a grudging respect as the information-brokers of the Kindred, given their supernatural acumen at stealth and the fact that many Kindred would rather ignore them than acknowledge them. Savvy Nosferatu exploit this for all it\u2019s worth, turning the hypocrisy of other vampires to their own profit.</p><p>On the whole, the Nosferatu condition is lonely and alienating.

Some of the Sewer Rats are cruel, as blighted on the inside as they are on the outside, while others are tragic, wretched creatures who have been cursed with eternal outsider status through no choice of their own.

No two Nosferatu share the exact same malformation, and the Clan is a freakshow of snarled limbs, fanged protrusions, hellish countenances, serpentine spines, ruined faces, spasmodic appendages, and even features not usually seen on the mortal stock from which the Nosferatu are drawn. The Sewer Rats often hide these disfigurements under shapeless robes and rags, but some exult in the discomfort their presence causes, and don\u2019t bother disguising them. They may even emphasize them.</p><p><b>Haven:</b> Nosferatu Kindred often make their havens far from the scorn and spite of other vampires. Whether they construct warrens in the sewers suggested by their nickname or they sculpt a sprawling nightmare-nest in the spire of a condemned church, Sewer Rats value secrecy and distance from rivals in their havens. Nosferatu of humbler means may well squat in an abandoned tenement or a disused alley. So long as it\u2019s away from other Kindred, it\u2019s a good haven.</p><p><b>Background:</b> The Sewer Rats mostly fit into one of two categories. Some Nosferatu Embrace the damaged, flawed, outcast, or vile, feeling some degree of kinship with them. Other Embrace spitefully, dragging the beautiful or privileged into an immortal hell of disfigurement and monstrosity.</p><p><b>Character Creation:</b> Many Nosferatu come from loner and outsider concepts, Natures, and Demeanors.

The Baali are one such power.</p><p>History \u2014 or legend, perhaps \u2014 claims that the childe of an Antediluvian made a pact with forces beyond human understanding in order to make war on the thirteen Clans. He took the name Baal-the-Destroyer, and he led his apostles against the Second City. The battle was terrible, and none caught in its wake were spared \u2014 Demon and Kindred alike perished. But the Baali and their unholy allies were routed and fled, and over the millennia, they faded from memory, to legend, to cautionary tale.</p><p>The Baali do still exist, though. The Inquisition weeded out the stupid and the careless, but left the clever and the patient. Some went into torpor, while others simply claimed membership in another Clan and begged for sanctuary. Now, in modern nights, the bloodline sees more concentrated activity than it has for centuries. Baali are explorers and seekers of secrets. They will do almost anything and sacrifice almost anyone to gain access to occult mysteries. They squander the wealth they have accumulated, they make deals they cannot possible hope to live up to, and they do so with no apology and no attempt at excuse. They seem to know that they are in decline, and that their bloodline is disappearing into the mists of time.</p><p>The bloodline has enemies, after all. Infernalists \u2014 those who call up and worship demons \u2014 are one of the very few beings that can be called \u201ccommon enemies\u201d by most of the denizens of the World of Darkness, Kindred and otherwise.</p><p>Despite their small numbers and host of enemies, the Baali are dangerous. They are not Faustian bargainers, looking for comfort or even knowledge. They do not wish to reign in Hell. They believe \u2014 they know \u2014 that the world is doomed. The End Times are here, and every sacrifice they make, every murder they incite, is one more chink in the dam holding back the deluge of blood called Gehenna.

Some Baali dress in expensive clothing, and some don\u2019t bother. Some become so fixated that they neglect outer appearance. Older Baali surround themselves with insects, rats, or other vermin.</p><p><b>Haven:</b> Baali tend to nest in places of antiquity. Libraries, universities, and stately homes attract the Demons. No matter where the Baali make their havens, though, the vampire\u2019s very presence changes the place. Vermin creep in first, and no amount of effort can keep them out.</p><p><b>Background:</b> The Baali value temperament above profession. Teachers, defrocked priests, laborers, artists \u2014 all have joined the ranks of the Baali. The bloodline even breeds their own recruits, drawing from ghoul families raised over the years to produce offspring suckled on the unholy truths that the Baali recite as gospel.</p><p><b>Character Creation:</b> Mental Attributes, especially Perception, are usually primary. A Baali\u2019s ability to tempt and entice depend on his insight into what a person truly wants. Social Attributes are also helpful, as the Baali need both to keep their identities a secret and convince others to open up to them.</p><p><b>Clan Disciplines:</b> Daimoinon, Obfuscate, Presence</p><p><b>Weakness:</b> Baali cannot bear to look upon or handle objects of any faith.

Outside the purview of the Sects, the Assamites are true independents and mercenaries, hiring out to whoever can pay their blood-price and ungoverned by the will of Prince or Priscus. By the time a mark realizes that he\u2019s being hunted by an Assamite, it\u2019s often far too late. Needless to say, this makes the Assamites both feared and reviled by many of the other Clans.</p><p>In truth, the Assamites are more than simple thugs and killers. Theirs is a complex but insular Clan predicated upon the three principles of wisdom, sorcery, and diablerie. Most Assamites that other vampires encounter are members of the warrior caste, however, so Kindred society has painted them all with that brush. For their part, the Assassins have done nothing to stop this misunderstanding. If it helps them acquire contracts and it occludes the true nature of their Clan, the better for them.</p><p>Long ago, the Assamites were brought to heel by a powerful curse to curb their bloodlust, levied by the Tremere at the behest of the Camarilla. They cannot taste the vitae of vampires without it causing them harm. In their ongoing quest to lower their Generation and bring themselves closer to their holy figure, Haqim (whom some outside scholars claim was of the Second Generation, while others insist he was a judge appointed by the other Antediluvians), the Assamites must refine the blood of Kindred into an alchemical solution. Were it not for this mystical yoke, the Assamites would surely be unchecked on a crusade of unholy diablerie.<p><p><b>Nickname:</b> Assassins</p><p><b>Sect:</b> For the most part, the Assamites tend to be independent, letting the Sects hire them to operate on their own terms. That said, some Assamites believe an allegiance with the Camarilla or the Sabbat would allow the entire Clan to stand more strongly.</p><p><b>Appearance</b>: Older Assamites often come from Middle Eastern and North African cultures, though more and more young Assamites come from a wider demographic. In traditional environments, the Assamites prefer garb appropriate to religious or Clan custom. When in public, however, Assamites wear whatever the locals do, allowing them to fulfill their contracts without anyone noticing anything amiss. An Assamite\u2019s skin grows darker with age (as opposed to other vampires, whose skin gets paler); particularly ancient Assamites are almost ebony in complexion.</p><p><b>Haven:</b> Assamites often share communal havens with others of their local cell, remote structures that allow the Assassins to watch the larger domain from a distance. These havens are generally well appointed, but not so lavish that the whole place can\u2019t be moved on short notice. Individual Assamites also tend to keep personal hideouts of a much more humble nature, for when they need a place to lay low.</p><p><b>Background:</b> Those Embraced into Clan Assamite tend to fall into two distinct types: The \u201cprovincial\u201d members of the Clan fit whatever their locality is, and can blend seamlessly in with the people around them. The higher-profile \u201cjet-setters\u201d transcend cultures, bolstered by their ability to handle interpersonal and intellectual challenges.</p><p><b>Character Creation:</b> Physical Attributes tend to be primary, with some Assamites favoring Social Attributes to help them get close to their prey. Talents and Skills are equally favored, but Knowledges may help the wise Assamite in a pinch. Few Assassins cultivate extensive Backgrounds, and instead specialize in an array of Disciplines that heighten their competence. The most accomplished Assamites follow the Clan\u2019s unique Path of Enlightenment, and those who don\u2019t often have to spend a great deal of effort maintaining their Virtues and Humanity.</p><p><b>Clan Disciplines:</b> Celerity, Obfuscate, Quietus</p><p><b>Weaknesses:</b> Due to the Tremere blood-curse, should an Assamite consume the blood of another Kindred, she suffers one automatic level of unsoakable lethal damage per blood point imbibed.

Resembling nothing so much as walking, rotting corpses, these odd vampires take their name and their origin from the Caribbean and the religion of vodoun (popularly known as voodoo). Baron Samedi, in legend, was a loa of death and ancestor worship. The vampires that bear his name and visage (for Samedi is often portrayed as a corpse, albeit not one so disgusting as the Stiffs) also often share his rude, blunt demeanor. In fact, a vampire going by the name of \u201cBaron Samedi\u201d seems to be the founder, or at least the oldest extant member, of the bloodline.</p><p>The Samedi might seem to be an offshoot of the Nosferatu, but their powers of Thanatosis \u2014 a Discipline dedicated to manipulating dead flesh \u2014 speak of a connection to the Giovanni or their doomed predecessors, the Cappadocians. If that is the case, though, the Samedi and the Giovanni went their separate ways long ago, for neither has anything good to say about the other. The reason for this enmity is not something that members of either line discuss in public, but the Giovanni apparently have a history with Baron Samedi himself. The Baron, still active in the bloodline\u2019s affairs, refuses to discuss the \u201cdeal\u201d that he had with Augustus Giovanni, but it must have been something of gravity for the mutual dislike to persist.</p><p>Samedi take the roles of enforcers and assassins in Kindred society. They don\u2019t do it on ideological grounds, like the Assamites, and thus they find work with Kindred who want to get what they paid for. The Samedi do not take contracts against Nosferatu or, strangely, Giovanni Kindred without a heavy fee, speaking to some regard or fear of these Clans. As with so many other facts about their line, the Samedi have nothing to say on the matter.</p><p><b>Nickname:</b> Stiffs</p><p><b>Sect:</b> Samedi occasionally join the Camarilla or the Sabbat, but for the most part they consider themselves independent.</p><p><b>Appearance:</b> Saying that a Samedi resembles a rotting corpse is, sadly, in no way a euphemism. Their flesh is soft and tends to leak fluid if poked too hard. Their ears and noses rot away (but still function normally), and tiny bits of their skin tend to slough off and regrow. Skin retracts from the eyes and teeth, giving them the appearance of grinning skulls, but too much meat clings to the cranium for them to achieve the cleaner horror of the Harbingers of Skulls. Some Samedi are leathery and dry, like unwrapped mummies. These Stiffs still stink, but their stench is more reminiscent of rotted flowers and old decay than fresh putrescence.</p><p><b>Haven:</b> The Samedi make havens in places where a moldering corpse and its stench aren\u2019t out of place. Morgues, mortuaries, graveyards, and meat packing plants house the occasional Samedi. Some members of the bloodline choose to dwell below ground like the Nosferatu, but this does lead to conflict between the Stiffs and the Sewer Rats.</p><p><b>Background:</b> The Samedi are a relatively young line. No Samedi older than 250 years is known to exist. Most of the older ones hail from the Caribbean islands or the southern United States. Neonate Samedi don\u2019t always share this connection to vodoun, but frequently were close to death (one way or another) before the Embrace.</p><p><b>Character Creation:</b> While Physical Attributes are a priority for those Samedi working as killers and enforcers, many Samedi lean toward Mental Traits. Samedi rarely have the Herd or Resources Backgrounds, and their standoffish and solitary nature means that Mentor and Allies are equally rare.</p><p><b>Clan Disciplines:</b> Fortitude, Obfuscate, Thanatosis</p><p><b>Weakness:</b> The Samedi, as mentioned, are putrid beyond words. Samedi characters have Appearance ratings of 0, and automatically fail Appearance rolls.</p><p><b>Organization:</b> The Samedi are too rare to be organized.

            "description": "<p>The Lamia were a bloodline of Cainites devoted to defending Clan Cappadocian. The founder of the bloodline, Lamia, claimed to be a daughter of Lilith, Adam\u2019s first wife. According to legend, a Cappadocian elder named Lazarus found her performing sacred rites to Lilith, the Dark Mother. Impressed by her skill and perhaps taken with her fierce beauty, he Embraced her. While she died and the Change took her, Lilith gave her a vision, a deep understanding of her future and that of the Cappadocians. When she recovered, she whispered something to Lazarus, and the Cappadocian elder fled in terror.</p><p>Lamia did find her way back to the Clan, though, and her bloodline became the guardians of the Cappadocians. They were never very numerous, but important Graverobbers often had at least one Gorgon standing at their side. The Lamia learned to feed sparingly, since their bite carried disease, and developed their own path of Necromancy based on the four humors. Over the centuries, they became an important resource for the Cappadocians. And yet, behind their loyalty was perhaps a greater dedication to the Dark Mother and to the vision of their founder.</p><p>The Revelation of the Dark Mother seems to have led the line to tragedy, however. The Lamia died defending the Cappadocians when the Giovanni subsumed the Clan. Augustus Giovanni murdered Lamia herself following his diablerie of Cappadocius, and the last known member of the bloodline was destroyed in 1718 as part of a Camarilla blood hunt.</p><p><b>Nickname:</b> Gorgons</p><p><b>Sect:</b> The Lamia were somewhere between the High and Low Clans. They were not a Clan, but were considered part of Clan Cappadocian in most Cainites\u2019 understanding. Other Cainites, however, treated them respectfully as servants or soldiers, both out of deference to their skills and to their patrons.</p><p><b>Appearance:</b> The Lamia did not share the Cappadocians\u2019 pallor. Many of them were of Mediterranean or Semitic descent, though as the Cappadocians traveled across Europe with their Gorgon bodyguards, other nationalities came into the bloodline as well. The bloodline was predominantly female, but it wasn\u2019t uncommon for Lamia to dress as men (usually armed and armored).</p><p><b>Haven:</b> The Lamia shared havens with their Cappadocian patrons. When they made their own, they often chose crypts and sarcophagi, preferring to be alone among the dead (feeding on the recently dead also minimized their chance of starting an outbreak of plague).</p><p><b>Background:</b> Since the Lamia Embraced women almost exclusively, they seldom had the chance to Embrace trained warriors. Instead, the Gorgons often chose women who had some experience with death. Women who had attempted or contemplated suicide, or had recently committed murder, were common choices. Likewise, women with a pronounced interest in black magic or scholarly pursuits in general were candidates for the Lamia Embrace. Training in combat could come after the gift of immortality.</p><p><b>Character Creation:</b> All Lamia had some combat training, usually from their sires. Physical or Mental Attributes might be primary, as were Skills. The Lamia also tended to have some familiarity with Occult, both from the rites taught to them by their own bloodline and simply by proximity to the Cappadocians.</p><p><b>Clan Disciplines:</b> Fortitude, Necromancy, Potence</p><p><b>Weakness:</b> The Lamia carried the \u201cSeed of Lilith,\u201d a wasting disease spread by their bite.

Any vampire that consumed Lamia blood became a carrier of the disease until all of the Lamia vitae had been purged from his body.</p><p><b>Organization:</b> The sire-childe relationship in the Lamia was very strong, as most Lamia had to remain with their sires for at least a year to achieve the necessary combat skill to be of use. Lamia remained the leader of the bloodline until her destruction, but her first and most important order to her daughter was to serve the Cappadocians.</p><div class=ttlStereo><h3>Stereotypes</h3><p><b>High Clans:</b> <i>Our masters\u2019 fellows cannot be trusted.

            "description": "<p>A blood moon casts a crimson light over the land beyond the forest and something fearsome howls its agony into the night. The Tzimisce call these lands their ancestral home. Since time out of mind the Fiends have been masters and lords of the domains of much of Eastern Europe. But theirs is a proud, selfish Clan for which tradition goes only so far despite their aristocratic origins. In fact, the Clan claims to have destroyed its Antediluvian, and in the wake of that momentous event, helped establish the foundations of the Sabbat.</p><p>Tzimisce practice a strange Discipline known as Vicissitude that allows them to twist the skin and bone of their victims. In many cases, they refine their fleshly arts by practicing upon themselves, but they just as frequently use it upon their lackeys and retainers, turning their boyars and <i>szlachta</i> into monstrous thralls. Vicissitude itself is a much misunderstood Discipline, and debates over its origins occasionally plunge the Clan into vicious partisan rivalries.</p><p>Clan Tzimisce is a Clan of extremes, and long, cold nights spent in remote castles have turned the Fiends\u2019 perspectives both greatly inward and outward. Mystics of the Clan study a philosophy of metamorphosis, seeking to discover what lies beyond the state of vampirism. An alien attitude of spiritual secularism characterizes many Tzimisce. Young members of the Clan often find themselves detached from the historical role of the Fiends as terrifying landed lords, and throw themselves wholly into a cause of their own choice, whether as Sabbat zealots, fleshcrafted horrors, or transcendental <i>koldun</i> sorcerers.</p><p><b>Nickname:</b> Fiends</p><p><b>Sect:</b> The Tzimisce are longtime but largely detached members of the Sabbat. They were instrumental in the Sect\u2019s nascence, and remain one of its most numerous Clans.</p><p><b>Appearance:</b> Given their ability to manipulate their physical appearance with Vicissitude, Tzimisce look however they want, and they often want to provoke or frighten. Some prefer extreme modifications and experimentations with their bodies that leave them looking only vaguely humanoid. Others seek to redefine and even transcend the limits of their forms, rebuilding themselves in the images of angels, monsters, nightmares, and things even less recognizable.</p><p><b>Haven:</b> Young Tzimisce are often Sabbat Priests or Ducti, and prefer to maintain communal havens with their packs. They encourage the pack to live in fearsome locations, such as beneath a hospital or morgue, or in the dank recesses of a mausoleum. Elders of the Clan sometimes have ancestral holdings in the Old World, and the image of the vampire on the craggy mountain in a crumbling castle owes much to Tzimisce lords. Rarely are these ancient holdings kept to any modern standards of comfort, but their lords are strangely hospitable to invited guests (and terribly intolerant of uninvited bores).</p><p><b>Background:</b> Elder Tzimisce, particularly those of the still-landed nobility in hoary old domains, may have family lines from which they Embrace, or they may restrict their occasional siring to the terrified villages suffering in thrall beneath their estates. New World and younger Tzimisce aren\u2019t as discriminating and are more practical. Indeed, many Tzimisce fledglings are little more than shock troops, Embraced and warped to the limits of their frames to cause revulsion and revel in bloodshed until put down.</p><p><b>Character Creation:</b> Few Tzimisce know moderation, and thus often favor Physical or Mental Attributes, usually with one extraordinarily high Trait. Knowledges are usually favored, though Skills are valued as well. Mentor, Allies, Domain, and Retainers are all quite appropriate to Tzimisce, as are narrow \u2014 almost overdeveloped \u2014 Disciplines. Their alien mindsets often lead them to follow Paths of Enlightenment. The ghastliness to which many Tzimisce are often exposed during their fledgling years sometimes results in complicated derangements.</p><p><b>Clan Disciplines:</b> Animalism, Auspex, Vicissitude</p><p><b>Weaknesses:</b> The Tzimisce are inextricably tied to their domains of origin, and must rest in the proximity of at least two handfuls of \u201cnative soil\u201d \u2014 earth from a place important to her as a mortal, such as the soil from her birthplace or the graveyard where she underwent her Embrace.

The penalty remains until she rests for a full day amid her earth once more.</p><p><b>Organization:</b> The Fiends are, on the whole, mistrustful of other Kindred, especially others of their own Clan. As such, Tzimisce organization, such as it is, has a high regard for solitude. It is against their nature to be inclusive, and thus they have to work at being Sabbat (though this is less difficult for younger Tzimisce of at least somewhat modern outlooks).

            "description": "<p>The Clan Brujah that most Kindred know in the modern nights is not, according to legend, the true lineage of the Antediluvian known as \u201cBrujah.\u201d The strange bloodline known as the True Brujah claim that Brujah\u2019s childe, Troile, committed diablerie upon him and stole control of the Clan. Brujah, it is said, was not the hot-blooded warrior/scholar that many vampires associate with the Rabble, but rather a staid, passionless introvert. Why, then, he chose to Embrace a maniac like Troile in the first place is a mystery that will likely never be fully explained.</p><p>The True Brujah were never subject to a massive purge as the Salubri or the Cappadocians were, but they don\u2019t Embrace often and never recovered from the theft of their Clan status. Their city \u2014 the Carthage of Kindred myth, in which vampires openly ruled over mortals \u2014 supposedly died out due to the treachery of Troile\u2019s childer (though other stories suggest demonic influence). From there, the bloodline faded from history. A few notable members of the bloodline appear throughout history, but by the modern nights only Kindred historians or those who chance to meet them can speak of their existence.</p><p>Whatever the truth of their origins, the True Brujah have remained a small but constant presence in Kindred society. Sometimes they wear their true nature openly, while other times they claim membership in other Clans (stating their Clan as \u201cBrujah,\u201d for example, and not bothering to correct the misapprehension that ensues). Their primary focus is the pursuit of knowledge, and to that end they have made some strange alliances. The True Brujah occasionally ally with the Followers of Set, and sometimes even provide services as consultants to the Sabbat in exchange for access to secrets and locations normally closed to them.</p><p><b>Nickname:</b> Sages</p><p><b>Sect:</b> The Sages have become more or less independent. They follow the Camarilla\u2019s rules when in their cities, and avoid the Sabbat lest they become pressed into service or destroyed. While it isn\u2019t impossible for a True Brujah to join the Sword of Caine, most of them can\u2019t summon up the necessary fervor.</p><p><b>Appearance:</b> In nights past, the True Brujah were predominantly of Greek or North African descent. As the centuries wore on, though, the Sages Embraced progeny from across Europe and, eventually, the New World. In modern nights, True Brujah tend to dress professionally, the better to fit in with the academic settings they prefer.</p><p><b>Haven:</b> Some True Brujah maintain multiple havens around the world, which they use as they travel pursuing whatever kind of knowledge they find most fascinating. Others stay closer to a given city, generally with a centuries-old university or other center of learning nearby. In either case, their havens tend to be clean, well-maintained, and austere.</p><p><b>Background:</b> It\u2019s not entirely accurate to say that the True Brujah only Embrace academics and scholars, but it\u2019s fairly rare for them to do otherwise. Sages sometimes Embrace out of curiosity or even spite, but for the most part they choose people whose capacity of learning and accumulated knowledge will benefit their sires.</p><p><b>Character Creation:</b> Mental Attributes and Knowledges are usually primary. True Brujah sires instruct their childer in the basics of Occult and some form of combat (it\u2019s just not practical to be unable to fight). Nature and Demeanor are often similar, if not identical, and never anything forceful or passionate. Common Backgrounds include Resources, Contacts, and Herd.</p><p><b>Clan Disciplines:</b> Potence, Presence, Temporis</p><p><b>Weakness:</b> True Brujah lose much of their emotional capacity when they are Embraced, and their ability for sympathy continues to deteriorate as they grow older. All Conscience and Conviction rolls are made at +2 difficulty (maximum 10), and ratings in Conscience, Conviction, Humanity, and Paths of Enlightenment cost double the normal experience costs.</p><p><b>Organization:</b> While their rarity precludes frequent meetings, the bloodline comes together twice a century to discuss matters that affect them all. The eldest members of the bloodline determine the location and specific time of the meeting. Outside of these larger meetings, many True Brujah stay in contact via letters, whether handwritten or online.</p><div class=ttlStereo><h3>Stereotypes</h3><p><b>Camarilla:</b> <i>After a certain point, a system becomes self-sustaining, and even if it no longer has any resemblance to its original purpose, it is too large to dismantle.</i></p><p><b>Sabbat:</b> <i>I strongly suspect that the future of all Kindred can be found in this Sect.

            "description": "<p>The story of Clan Cappadocian is tragic, but illustrative of the parasitic cycle of Kindred existence. Nothing lasts forever in vampiric circles, but nothing ever truly dies.</p><p>The Cappadocians were a Clan that focused on death and undeath. Their founder, an ancient known simply as \u201cCappadocius\u201d (\u201cof Cappadocia\u201d), did not attempt to rule his Clan. He asked only that they continue the search for truth and the secrets of life and death. The Clan\u2019s ancestral roots were rumored to be somewhere in Asia Minor, but by the end of the Dark Ages they had spread throughout Europe. Known as scholars, mystics, and necromancers, the Cappadocians were as firmly entrenched in the Cainite society of their time as any of the Clans of the Camarilla are tonight.</p><p>The Graverobbers expanded their knowledge base by Embracing members of important families or promising scholars. By the 13th century they had inroads across Europe, in monasteries, universities, and in the courts of royalty, but also members and ghouls among the working classes. Everyone must eventually die, the Cappadocians realized, and every death was potentially a lesson.</p><p>Their inclusive attitude may have spelled the Clan\u2019s doom. They accepted a Venetian merchant family called the Giovanni (the family\u2019s propensity for summoning up and controlling ghosts had as much to do with their Embrace as their skill with finance). Over the following centuries, the Giovanni worked their way into the hierarchy of the Clan, until Augustus Giovanni committed diablerie upon Cappadocius. Over the next few centuries, the Giovanni systematically destroyed the remaining Cappadocians. In modern nights, only small remnants survive, such as the Harbingers of Skulls. The lineage of these remnants is largely unknown.</p><p><b>Nickname:</b> Graverobbers</p><p><b>Sect:</b> The Cappadocians did not survive long enough to take a side in the Camarilla/Sabbat divide.</p><p><b>Appearance:</b> The Graverobbers were pale and corpse-like, even for vampires. Their hair often darkened slightly after the Embrace, giving them even more of an ethereal appearance. The Cappadocians dressed appropriately for their station and role.</p><p><b>Haven:</b> Cappadocians preferred a measure of solitude when choosing their havens. Although they had to stay close enough to mortals to feed, they often chose quiet locales to make their homes \u2014 monasteries, crypts, and even sewers or cisterns. The Cappadocians acting as scholars or advisors enjoyed a better standard of unlife, but even they often chose places that mortals had no interest in exploring.</p><p><b>Background:</b> As a general rule, the Cappadocians were not concerned with ethnicity or nationality when Embracing, meaning that it wasn\u2019t uncommon to find Moors, Jews, or even pagans brought into the Clan. The Graverobbers were more inclined to Embrace people with an interest in death. That didn\u2019t necessarily mean causing death (though certainly they Embraced their share of soldiers and hunters), but scholars of the afterlife and religion, gravediggers, priests, and hermits all found their way to Clan Cappadocian.</p><p><b>Character Creation:</b> Mental Attributes and Knowledges were often primary, and rare was the Cappadocian without at least a few dots of Occult. The Clan included warriors as well as scholars and priests, and a Cappadocian who chose to be a tyrant could be a frightening creature indeed. For the most part, though, the Clan tended more toward intellectual and spiritual pursuits, and choices of Abilities and Backgrounds reflected that.</p><p><b>Clan Disciplines:</b> Auspex, Fortitude, Necromancy</p><p><b>Weakness:</b> As mentioned, the Cappadocians exhibited a deathly pallor, and this only worsened as the vampire grew older. Young Cappadocians were able to pass for human (though mortals that knew what to look for could pick them out easily), but elder Cappadocians showed shriveled skin and a much more withered countenance.</p><p><b>Organization:</b> Clan Cappadocian was, in its heyday, an important Clan historically. It claimed domain in several important cities across Europe, and it wasn\u2019t uncommon for Graverobbers to act as spiritual or mystical advisors to other medieval Princes. Internally, the Clan had little strict hierarchy, though as the years wore on the Clan\u2019s core became more localized around the founder (which, in turn, allowed the Giovanni to take it over).</p><div class=ttlStereo><h3>Stereotypes</h3><p><b>High Clans:</b> <i>We have seen the death of kings, and it is much like the death of peasants.

            "description": "<p>The Ravnos move like the rumors that surround them. They are the thief in the night, the <i>raksha</i> chased by the wind, the nightmare-dream too fearful to be real. Whether associated with the Romani folk of Europe or the grave-robbing gh\u00fbl of Western Asia, Kindred society burdens the Ravnos with prejudices of foulness, uncleanliness, and wickedness.</p><p>With reputations like these, the Ravnos are considered outsiders even among those Kindred who do not ally themselves with Sects. Many young Ravnos tend toward nomadic unlives, moving from one domain to the next or hiding on the fringes of established territories where they can escape if local Kindred sentiment turns against them. This exacerbates their reputations as transients, gypsies, and vagrant scourges, but Ravnos vampires adapt well, thriving in their marginalized role. In fact, many choose to make themselves into the ravening terrors that other Kindred believe them to be.</p><p>The more enlightened among the Ravnos follow a Clan ideology inspired by the cycle of reincarnation espoused by many Indian faiths. Among some young and unprincipled members of the Clan, however, this philosophy becomes a penchant for capriciousness or an excuse for chaos. It is these latter Kindred who give so many Ravnos a bad name, but even the devout seem bizarre to many vampires.</p><p>The Ravnos practice a unique Discipline known as Chimerstry that convinces their enemies that they see things that do not exist. Chimerstry does much to convince Kindred that the Ravnos trade in lies and misdirection, but it can also prove to be a Deceiver\u2019s salvation and ease the vagaries of an outcast unlife.</p><p><b>Nickname:</b> Deceivers</p><p><b>Sect:</b> Clan Ravnos often has a difficult time heeding the rigorous order of many Camarilla cities, and has no inherent love for the violence of the Sabbat. Thus, the Deceivers find themselves independent for lack of a more suitable option.</p><p><b>Appearance:</b> Young Ravnos often come from Eastern European Romani stock, with a relative paucity of \u201cnon-gypsy\u201d <i>gadje</i> in the ranks. What few elders of the Clan may remain are presumed to come from Indian or Middle Eastern origins. Given that the Clan is widely spread and holds no traditional central domain, no consistent look can be said to be predominant, and any mendicant Kindred might be of Ravnos origin.</p><p><b>Haven:</b> Many Ravnos take to the road instead of establishing permanent havens, dwelling temporarily among itinerant communities, at roadside rest stops, or even in vehicles. When a Deceiver does put down roots in a domain, his permanent haven is often away from high-profile Kindred territories. Havens in ethnic ghettos, industrial outskirts, and isolated geography are safest and most easily cultivated for the Ravnos.</p><p><b>Background:</b> The Ravnos are scattered and suspicious, and those childer who don\u2019t have the tendency toward self-sufficiency don\u2019t last long. In many cases, a Ravnos will either never sire, or sire for companionship or safety, with little concern for how well a childe will fare as a vampire. Ravnos rarely seek out childer actively, instead drawing from those whose paths they cross on any given night. As such, the hard-luck drifter reputation tends to follow the Deceivers.</p><p><b>Character Creation:</b> Outsider and selfish Natures are common among the Clan. Physical and Social Attributes predominate, as do Talents and Skills. Savvy Ravnos develop a breadth of Backgrounds that can give them an edge when they\u2019re on the move or in a tight spot, such as stashed Resources, defensible Domain, and a few Allies or Contacts.</p><p><b>Clan Disciplines:</b> Animalism, Chimerstry, Fortitude</p><p><b>Weaknesses:</b> A turbulent history makes the Ravnos slaves to their vices. Each Ravnos has a penchant for some sort of vice \u2014 lying, cruelty, or theft, for example. When presented with the opportunity to engage in that vice, the Ravnos must indulge it unless her player succeeds on a Self-Control or Instinct roll (difficulty 6).</p><p><b>Organization:</b> The Ravnos are a far-flung Clan, with little to unite them and an open acknowledgement that each Deceiver looks after his own interests first. That said, Ravnos often like to make a great show of Clan camaraderie and cultural ritual, even though they know that promises made to one another are as fleeting as whispers on a night wind. Deceivers have been known to ally against common enemies such as tyrant Princes or Sabbat pogroms, but these alliances quickly fade once the threat no longer exists.</p><div class=ttlStereo><h3>Stereotypes</h3><p><b>Assamite:</b> <i>Half the time, I think we take a lot of shit because other vampires think, \u201cAll A-rabs look alike\u201d and confuse us with these assholes.</i></p><p><b>Brujah:</b> <i>You can get into a lot of trouble if one of these bloodsuckers imagines you did him some awful wrong when all you were doing was checking out his girlfriend.</i></p><p><b>Followers of Set:</b> <i>There\u2019s no justice.

            "description": "<p>Few Kindred have ever beheld the Northern Lights. The trek to the far reaches of the world, in a place inhospitable to man, beast, or vampire, with no reliable way to feed is enough to put even the most curious Cainite off the idea. And yet, a bloodline of vampires managed to dwell close enough to see these lights on a regular basis. This line \u2014 the Noiad \u2014 felt it was their sacred duty to witness the Northern Lights and interpret the will of the gods. Their mortal charges, a nomadic tribe called the Sam\u00ed, lived in fear and awe of their godlike protectors. The Noiad defended the Sam\u00ed from outside threats, both natural and supernatural, and acted as shamans and teachers for these wanderers. In return, the Sam\u00ed gave of their blood and kept the Noiad safe during the long months with no darkness.</p><p>Of course, the touch of the Kindred corrupts everything. The Noiad protected the Sam\u00ed from monsters from the wastes, and their blood allowed the mortals to survive times of famine, but the Wanderers also refused to allow their mortal herds to change or improve. Interlopers were turned aside or killed, regardless of their intentions. When it became clear that the march of Christianity (and Lasombra working within the Church) could not be stopped, the Noiad pushed the Sam\u00ed further north, away from the herds that would sustain them and away from the dawning of a new era. Whether the Noiad saw something in the Northern Lights that spurred them to this decision, or whether it was simply fear of change, is not important in the end. The Noiad drove the Sam\u00ed almost to destruction.</p><p><b>Nickname:</b> Wanderers</p><p><b>Sect:</b> The Noiad never belonged to a Sect, and were largely apart from the vampire politics of the day (at least until war pushed far enough north to inconvenience them). As a Gangrel offshoot, other Cainites would have considered them a Low Clan, on the rare occasion that other Cainites learned enough about them to have opinions at all.</p><p><b>Appearance:</b> The Noiad dwelled openly among the Sam\u00ed, and Embraced exclusively from this population. Most Noaid were dark-haired and strongly built from their demanding lifestyles pre-Embrace. Their skin tone, of course, tended to be lighter than their still-living comrades.</p><p><b>Haven:</b> The Sam\u00ed constructed mobile \u201chavens\u201d that could be dragged behind them as they traveled by day. If terrain or numbers made this impossible, the Sam\u00ed would watch in awe as their heavenly protectors sank into the earth, only to rejoin them the next night.</p><p><b>Background:</b> The Sam\u00ed selected for Embrace tended to be those with talent for divination, as well as dream and star interpretation. The Noiad also watched children descended from families that included at least one vampire, looking for the traits they favored. Physicality was not a primary concern, but only because Sam\u00ed that were not physically capable of thriving in the harsh climates didn\u2019t live long enough to be considered for the Embrace anyway.</p><p><b>Character Creation:</b> Physical Attributes weren\u2019t necessarily primary, but tended to be no worse than average.

            "description": "You are the ultimate mercenary, realizing that there is always a market to be developed - anything can be commodity. You have a keen understanding of how to manipulate both kine and Cainites into thinking that they need specific goods or services. Appearance and influence are everything when it comes to the big sale, though you\u2019ll use anything to your advantage. Salesmen, soldiers of fortune, and bootlickers all adhere to the Capitalist Archetype.\n - Regain a point of Willpower whenever you make a successful \u201csale\u201d of any commodity. Commodities need not be physical items; they may be bits of information, favors, or other intangibles."

            "name": "Soldier",
            "description": "The Soldier is not a blindly loyal follower. While she exists for orders, she does not adhere to them unquestioningly. More independent than a Conformist but too tied into the idea of command to be a Loner, the Soldier applies her own techniques to others\u2019 goals. While she may seek command herself someday, her ambitions lie within the established hierarchy and structure. The Soldier has no compunctions about using whatever means necessary to do what needs to be done, so long as the orders to do so came from the right place.\n - Regain a point of Willpower when you achieve your orders\u2019 objectives. The more difficult the orders are to fulfill, the better it feels to accomplish them. At Storyteller discretion, pulling off a spectacular success or fulfilling a lengthy mission may well be worth additional Willpower points."

            "description": "To a Scientist, existence is a puzzle which she can help to reassemble. A Scientist logically and methodically examines her every situation and maneuver, looking for logical outcomes and patterns. This is not to say that the Scientist is always looking for a scientific or rational explanation, but rather she examines her surroundings rigorously and with a critical eye. The system a Scientist attempts to impose on the world maybe completely ludicrous, but it is a system, and she sticks by it.\n - Regain Willpower any time a logical, systematic approach to a problem helps you solve it, or information gathered logically is of use in another, similar situation."

He seeks prominence for its own sake, not because he has an operation\u2019s best interests at heart or because he has the best ideas (though he may certainly think so). He may genuinely believe others are incompetent, but ultimately he craves power and control. Dictators, gang leaders, bullies, corporate raiders and their ilk are Autocrat Archetypes. A Kindred Autocrat may crave a title, or he may wish to be recognized as the leader of a coterie.\n - Regain a point of Willpower when you achieve control over a group or organization involving other individuals."

            "description": "Independent and self-reliant, you carefully study the behavior and mannerisms of everyone you come in contact with so you can pass yourself off as someone else later. You spend so much time altering your mannerisms and appearance that your own sire may not even recognize you. Spies, con artists, drag queens, and impostors best represent the Chameleon.\n - Regain a point of Willpower whenever you fool someone into thinking you\u2019re someone else for your own (or your pack or coterie\u2019s) benefit."

Attention drives the Gallant, and the chase is often as important as its end. Nothing excites a Gallant so much as a new audience to woo. Performers, only children, and those with low self-esteem often embody the Gallant Archetype. Kindred Gallants may be Harpies, or they may have enormous herds of doting thralls.\n - Regain a Willpower point whenever you successfully impress another person. Ultimately, the Storyteller is the arbiter of how much you dazzle someone, even in the case of other players\u2019 characters."

            "description": "The Child is still immature in personality and temperament. He wants what he wants now, and often prefers someone to give it to him. Although he can typically care for himself, he would rather have someone cater to his capricious desires. Some Child Archetypes are actually innocent rather than immature, ignorant of the cold ways of the real world. Actual children, spoiled individuals, and some drug abusers are Child Archetypes. Kindred with the Child Archetype might have not yet fully reached an understanding of the world and have some characteristic such as cruelty, entitlement, sympathy, or hunger that is out of balance with their other personality aspects, as they haven\u2019t yet reached the \u201crounded\u201d state of adulthood. Note that a Child Archetype need not be a physical, literal child at the time of Embrace. Some people simply never grow up.\n - Regain a point of Willpower whenever you manage to convince someone to help you with no gain to herself, or to nurture you."
