[{"ID":"1","Name":"The Sepulchre Path","IsAssam":"0","IsKoldu":"0","IsNecro":"1","IsThaum":"0","Descr":"Through the Sepulchre path, the vampire can witness, summon, and command the spirits of the dead. At higher levels, the necromancer can force the ghost to remain in a particular place or object, or even damage wraiths directly. Since many other areas of Necromancy involve dealing with ghosts, this is the most common path for necromancers to start with.<br>Note: If a Kindred uses a Sepulchre Path power in the presence of something of great importance to the ghost the power affects, the chances for success in the summoning increase dramatically (reduce the difficulty by 2). This might be the bathtub in which the ghost\u2019s mortal body was drowned, the rusted-out wreck of the car where the ghost\u2019s physical body was trapped alive, or something unrelated to the ghost\u2019s demise, such as a favorite book or a child-ghost\u2019s beloved nursery.","Level1":"<b>Witness of Death<\/b><br>Before it is possible to control the dead, one must perceive them. This power allows just that, attuning a vampire\u2019s unliving senses to the presence of the incorporeal.<br>Under its effects, a necromancer sees ghosts as translucent phantoms gliding among the living and hears their whispers and moans. She feels the spectral cold of their touch and smells their musty hint of decay. Yet one cannot mistake the dead for the living, as they lack true substance, and appear dimmer and less real than creatures of flesh and blood. When a vampire uses this power, her eyes flicker with pale blue fire that only the dead can see.<br>Ghosts resent being spied upon, and more powerful shades may use their own powers to inflict their displeasure on the incautious.<br><b>System<\/b>: The player rolls ^Perception + Awareness^ (difficulty 5). Success allows the vampire to perceive ghosts as described for the rest of the scene (in the mortal world - seeing ghosts in the land of the dead requires Shroudsight, on p. 163). Failure has no special effect, but a botch means the vampire can see only the dead for the scene; everything else appears as shapeless, dim shadows. While the vampire\u2019s other senses remain attuned to the living, he is all but blind in this state and suffers a +3 difficulty to most vision-based Perception rolls and attacks. Ghosts notice the glowing eyes of a vampire using this power only with a successful Perception + Alertness roll (difficulty 7).","Level2":"<b>Summon Soul<\/b><br>The power of Summon Soul allows a necromancer to call a ghost back from the Underworld, for conversational purposes only. In order to perform this feat (and indeed, most of the feats in this path), the vampire must meet certain conditions:<br>1. The necromancer must know the name of the wraith in question, though an image of the wraith obtained via Witness of Death (see above), Shroudsight (see p. 163), Auspex, or other supernatural perception will suffice.<br>2. An object with which the wraith had some contact in life must be in the vicinity, though it need not be something of significant importance to the ghost\u2019s living consciousness. A piece of the ghost\u2019s corpse works well for this purpose (and even provides a -1 difficulty modifier).<br>Certain types of ghosts cannot be summoned with this power. Vampires who achieved Golconda before their Final Deaths, or who were diablerized, are beyond the reach of this summons. Likewise, many ghosts of the dead cannot be called - they are destroyed, unable to return to the mortal plane, or lost in the eternal storm of the Underworld.<br><b>System<\/b>: The player spends one blood point and rolls ^Manipulation + Occult^ (difficulty equal to 7 or the ghost\u2019s Willpower, whichever is higher). The vampire must know the name of the ghost and have on hand an object the ghost had contact with in life. Provided that the target has died and become a ghost, success means the shade appears before the necromancer as described above. Not everyone becomes a ghost - it requires a strong will to persevere in the face of death, and souls that have found peace pass on to their eternal rewards. Moreover, it is possible for the dead to suffer spiritual dissolution and destruction after they become ghosts. The Storyteller should consider all these factors when deciding whether a particular ghost exists for a vampire to summon.<br>Vampires know if their summons should have succeeded by a feeling of sudden, terrifying descent as they reach too far into the great Beyond, so this power can be used to determine whether a soul has endured beyond death. While a failure means the vampire wastes blood, a botch calls a spirit other than the one sought - usually a malevolent ghost known as a Spectre (see p. 385). Such a fiend torments the one who summoned it with every wicked power at its disposal.<br>Once a ghost is summoned, it may not deliberately move out of sight of the vampire, though it can take any other actions, including direct attack. The vampire\u2019s player may spend a Willpower point to dismiss the ghost at any time (unless he rolled a botch). Otherwise, at the end of the scene, shadows engulf the spirit once more and return it to its original location.","Level3":"<b>Compel Soul<\/b><br>With this power, a vampire can command a ghost to do his bidding for a while. Compulsion of the soul is a perilous undertaking and, when used improperly, can endanger vampire and wraith alike.<br><b>System<\/b>: The vampire locates and approaches the intended ghost or calls it to his presence with Summon Soul. As with the previous power, he must have the ghost\u2019s name and an object it handled in life. His player then spends one blood point and rolls ^Manipulation + Occult^ in a resisted roll against the ghost\u2019s Willpower (difficulty 6 for both rolls).<br>If the vampire wins, the number of net successes determines the degree of control he has over the ghost (as described below). Moreover, the vampire\u2019s control keeps ghosts that have been called with Summon Soul from returning to their original locations at the end of the scene. If the ghost wins, the vampire loses a number of Willpower points equal to the ghost\u2019s net successes.<br>On a tie, the roll becomes an extended contest that continues each turn until one side wins. If the vampire botches at any point, the ghost is immune to any use of the vampire\u2019s Necromancy for the rest of the scene. If the ghost botches, it must obey as if the vampire\u2019s player had rolled five net successes.<br><table><tr><th>Successes<\/th><th>Result<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>1 success<\/td><td>The ghost must perform one simple task for the vampire that does not place it in certain danger. It must attend to this task immediately, although it can delay the compulsion and pursue its own business at a cost of one Willpower point per scene. The ghost may not attack the vampire until this task is complete. It is possible to issue the task of answering one question, in which case the ghost must answer truthfully and to the best of its knowledge.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2 successes<\/td><td>The vampire may issue two orders or ask two questions as outlined for one success. Alternatively, the vampire may demand a simple task with a real possibility of danger, as long as the danger is not certain. The ghost may delay this compulsion with Willpower.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3 successes<\/td><td>The vampire may issue three orders as outlined for one success. Alternatively, he may demand the ghost fulfill one difficult and dangerous task or a simple assignment that has an extended duration of up to one month. The ghost may delay such orders with Willpower.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4 successes<\/td><td>The vampire may issue four orders, as outlined for one success, or assign two tasks, as for two successes. Alternatively, the vampire may command the ghost to perform one complex assignment that puts the ghost at extreme risk, or perform any number of non-threatening tasks as the vampire\u2019s slave for up to one month (or, if the necromancer spends  a permanent point of Willpower, for a year and a day). It is possible for ghosts to delay individual tasks, but not put off enslavement.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5+ successes<\/td><td>The vampire may issue multiple orders that have a sum complexity or danger of five successes\u2019 worth. Instead, the vampire may order the ghost to perform any one action that it is capable of executing within one month. Such a task can place the ghost in immediate peril of destruction, or even force it to betray and assault loved ones. It is not possible for ghosts to delay a task of this magnitude with Willpower - they must obey.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Level4":"<b>Haunting<\/b><br>Haunting binds a summoned ghost to a particular location or, in extreme cases, an object. The wraith cannot leave the area to which the necromancer binds it without risking destruction.<br><b>System<\/b>: The player spends one blood point while standing at the location for the haunting or touching the intended prison. She then has the ghost brought to her by whatever means she desires, though Summon Soul is quickest and most reliable. Her player then rolls ^Manipulation + Occult^ (difficulty is equal to the target\u2019s current Willpower points if resisted, to a minimum of 4; otherwise it is 4). The difficulty rises by one if the vampire wishes to place the ghost in an object.<br>As usual, the difficulty decreases by one if the necromancer has a part of the spirit\u2019s corpse in addition to knowing its name (minimum difficulty 3).<br>Each success binds the ghost within the location or object for one night. This duration extends to one week if the player spends a Willpower point or a year and a day for a dot of permanent Willpower. A wraith attempting to leave the area of a haunting must make an extended Willpower roll (difficulty 9, four cumulative successes necessary in a single scene) or take a level of aggravated damage for each roll. If the wraith runs out of health levels, it is hurled deep into the Underworld to face destruction.","Level5":"<b>Torment<\/b><br>It is through the use of this power that powerful necromancers convince bound ghosts to behave - or else. Torment allows the vampire to strike a wraith as if he himself were in the lands of the dead, inflicting damage on the wraith\u2019s ectoplasmic form. The vampire remains in the real world, however, so he cannot be struck in return.<br><b>System<\/b>: The player rolls ^Stamina + Empathy^ (difficulty equal to the wraith\u2019s current Willpower points), and the vampire reaches out to strike the wraith. Each success inflicts a level of lethal damage on the wraith. Should the wraith lose all health levels, it immediately vanishes into what appears to be a doorway to some hideous nightmare realm. Ghosts \u201cdestroyed\u201d thus cannot reappear in or near the real world for a month."}, {"ID":"2","Name":"The Ash Path","IsAssam":"0","IsKoldu":"0","IsNecro":"1","IsThaum":"0","Descr":"The Ash Path allows necromancers to peer into the lands of the dead, and even affect things there. Of the paths of Necromancy, the Ash Path is the most perilous to learn, because many of the path\u2019s uses increase a necromancer\u2019s vulnerability to wraiths.","Level1":"<b>Shroudsight<\/b><br>Shroudsight allows a necromancer to see through the Shroud, the mystical barrier that separates the living world from the Underworld. By using this power, the vampire can spot ghostly buildings and items, the landscape of the so-called Shadowlands, and even wraiths themselves. However, an observant wraith may notice when a vampire suddenly starts staring at him, which can lead to unpleasant consequences.<br><b>System<\/b>: A simple roll of ^Perception + Awareness^ (difficulty 7) allows a necromancer to utilize Shroudsight. The effects last for a scene.","Level2":"<b>Lifeless Tongues<\/b><br>Where Shroudsight allows a necromancer to see ghosts, Lifeless Tongues allows her to converse with them effortlessly. Once Lifeless Tongues is employed, the vampire can carry on a conversation with the denizens of the ghostly Underworld without spending blood or causing the wraiths to expend any effort.<br><b>System<\/b>: To use Lifeless Tongues requires a roll of ^Perception + Occult^ (difficulty 6) and the expenditure of a Willpower point.","Level3":"<b>Dead Hand<\/b><br>Similar to the Sepulchre Path power Torment, Dead Hand allows a necromancer to reach across the Shroud and affect a ghostly object as if it were in the real world. Ghosts are solid to necromancers using this power, and can be attacked. Furthermore, the necromancer can pick up ghostly items, scale ghostly architecture (giving real-world bystanders the impression that he\u2019s climbing on air!), and generally exist in two worlds. On the other hand, a necromancer using Dead Hand is quite solid to the residents of the Underworld - and to whatever hostilities they might have.<br><b>System<\/b>: The player spends a point of Willpower and makes a successful ^Wits + Occult^ roll (difficulty 7) to activate Dead Hand for one scene. For each additional scene the vampire wishes to remain in contact with the Underworld, he must spend a point of blood.","Level4":"<b>Ex Nihilo<\/b><br>Ex Nihilo allows a necromancer to enter the Underworld physically. While in the lands of the dead, the vampire is essentially a particularly solid ghost. He maintains his normal number of health levels, but can be hurt only by things that inflict aggravated damage on ghosts (weapons forged from souls, certain ghostly powers, etc.). A vampire physically in the Underworld can pass through solid objects in the real world (at the cost of one health level) and remain \u201cincorporeal\u201d for a number of turns equal to her Stamina rating. On the other hand, vampires present in the Underworld are subject to all of the Underworld\u2019s perils, including ultimate destruction. A vampire killed in the realm of the dead is gone forever, beyond even the reach of other necromancers.<br><b>System<\/b>: Using Ex Nihilo takes a tremendous toll on the necromancer. To activate this power, the vampire must first draw a doorway with chalk or blood on any available surface. (The vampire may draw doors ahead of time for exactly this purpose.) The player must then expend two points of Willpower and two points of blood before making a ^Stamina + Occult^ roll (difficulty 8) as the vampire attempts to open the chalk door physically. If the roll succeeds, the door opens and the vampire steps through into the Underworld.<br>When the vampire wishes to return to the real world, he merely needs to concentrate (and the player spends another Willpower point and rolls ^Stamina + Occult^, difficulty 6). At Storyteller discretion, a vampire who is too deeply immersed in the Underworld may need to journey to a place close to the lands of the living in order to cross over. Vampires who wander too far into the lands of the dead may be trapped there forever. Vampires in the Underworld cannot feed upon ghosts without the use of another power; their only sustenance is the blood they bring with them.","Level5":"<b>Shroud Mastery<\/b><br>Shroud Mastery offers the Kindred the ability to manipulate the veil between the worlds of the living and the dead. By doing so, a necromancer can make it easier for bound wraiths in his service to function, or make it nearly impossible for ghosts to contact the material world.<br><b>System<\/b>: To exercise Shroud Mastery, the necromancer expends two points of Willpower, then states whether he is attempting to raise or lower the Shroud. The player then makes a ^Willpower^ roll (difficulty 9). Each success on the roll raises or lowers the difficulties of all nearby wraiths\u2019 attempts to cross the Shroud in any way by one, to a maximum of 10 or a minimum of 3. The Shroud reverts to its normal strength at a rate of one point per hour thereafter."}, {"ID":"3","Name":"The Bone Path","IsAssam":"0","IsKoldu":"0","IsNecro":"1","IsThaum":"0","Descr":"The Bone Path is concerned primarily with corpses and the methods by which dead souls can be restored to the living world - temporarily or otherwise.","Level1":"<b>Tremens<\/b><br>Tremens allows a necromancer to make the flesh of a corpse shift once. An arm might suddenly flop forward, a cadaver might sit up, or dead eyes might abruptly open. This sort of thing tends to have an impressive impact on people who aren\u2019t expecting a departed relative to roll over in his coffin.<br><b>System<\/b>: To use Tremens, the necromancer spends a single blood point, and the player must succeed on a ^Dexterity + Occult^ roll (difficulty 6). The more successes that are achieved, the more complicated an action can be effected in the corpse. One success allows for an instantaneous movement, such as a twitch, while five allow the vampire to set up specific conditions under which the body animates (\u201cThe next time someone enters the room, I want the corpse to sit up and open its eyes.\u201d). Under no circumstances can Tremens cause a dead body to attack or cause damage.","Level2":"<b>Apprentice\u2019s Brooms<\/b><br>With Apprentice\u2019s Brooms, the necromancer can make a dead body rise and perform a simple function. For example, the corpse could be set to carrying heavy objects, digging, or just shambling from place to place. The cadavers thus animated do not attack or defend themselves if interfered with, but instead attempt to carry out their given instructions until such time as they\u2019ve been rendered inanimate. Generally it takes dismemberment, flame, or something similar to destroy a corpse animated in this way.<br><b>System<\/b>: A roll of ^Wits + Occult^ (difficulty 7) and the expenditure of a point of both blood and Willpower are all that is necessary to animate corpses with Apprentice\u2019s Brooms. The number of corpses animated is equal to the number of successes achieved. The necromancer must then state the task to which he is setting his zombies. The cadavers turn themselves to their work until they finish the job (at which point they collapse) or something (including time) destroys them.<br>Corpses animated in this way have no initiative of their own, and are unable to make value judgments. They respond to very literal instruction. Thus, a zombie could be told \u201csweep this room every day until all the dust and cobwebs are gone\u201d or \u201ctranscribe this manuscript\u201d with an expectation of reasonable results, while a more open-ended command such as \u201cfix this motorcycle\u201d or \u201cresearch this Necromantic ritual and write down the results\u201d would be doomed to failure.<br>Bodies energized by this power continue to decay, albeit at a much slower rate than normal.<br><u>Zombie Statistics<\/u><br>Corpses animated by a necromancer of the Bone Path have Strength 3, Dexterity 2, Stamina 4, Brawl 2, and always act last in a turn (unless there are mitigating circumstances). They have zero Willpower points to spend, but resist attacks as if they have Willpower ratings of 10. All Mental and Social ratings are zero for a reanimated corpse, and zombies never attempt to dodge. Zombies\u2019 dice pools are not affected by damage, except that caused by fire or the claws and teeth of supernatural creatures. Most zombies have 10 health levels, but they are incapable of healing any damage they suffer. They have no minds or personalities to affect, so they are immune to uses of powers such as Dominate and Presence. Unless otherwise noted, they likewise cannot be usurped from the control of the necromancer invoking them.","Level3":"<b>Shambling Hordes<\/b><br>Shambling Hordes creates obvious results: reanimated corpses with the ability to attack, albeit neither very well nor very quickly. Once primed by this power, the corpses wait - for years, if necessary - to fulfill the command given them. The orders might be to protect a certain site or simply to attack immediately, but they will be carried out until every last one of the decomposing monsters is destroyed.<br><b>System<\/b>: The player spends a point of Willpower. The player then must succeed on a ^Wits + Occult^ roll (difficulty 8). Each success allows the vampire to raise another corpse from the grave, and costs one blood point. If the player cannot or chooses not to pay the blood point cost of additional zombies past a certain number, the extra successes are simply lost. Each zombie can follow one simple instruction, such as \u201cStay here and guard this graveyard against any intruders,\u201d or \u201cKill them!\u201d<br>Note: Zombies created by Shambling Hordes will wait forever if need be to fulfill their functions. Long after the flesh has rotted off their mystically animated bones, the zombies will wait and wait and wait, still able to perform their duties.","Level4":"<b>Soul Stealing<\/b><br>This power affects the living, not the dead. It does, however, temporarily turn a living soul into a sort of wraith, as it allows a necromancer to strip a soul from a living body. A mortal exiled from his body by this power becomes a wraith with a single tie to the real world: his now-empty body.<br><b>System<\/b>: The player spends a point of Willpower and then makes a contested ^Willpower^ roll against the intended victim (difficulty 6). Successes indicate the number of hours during which the original soul is forced out of its housing. The body itself remains autonomically alive but catatonic.<br>This power can be used to create suitable hosts for Daemonic Possession. It has no effect on Kindred or other supernatural creatures (except ghouls) until such creatures are dead - in the case of vampires, this means Final Death.","Level5":"<b>Daemonic Possession<\/b><br>Daemonic Possession lets a vampire insert a soul into a freshly dead body. This does not turn the reanimated corpse into anything other than a reanimated corpse, one that will irrevocably decay after a week, but it does give either a wraith or a free-floating soul (say, that of a vampire using Psychic Projection) a temporary home in the physical world.<br><b>System<\/b>: The body in question must be no more than 30 minutes dead, and the new tenant must agree to inhabit it - a ghost or astral form cannot be forced into a new shell. However, most ghosts would gladly seize the opportunity. Should the vampire, for whatever reason, wish to insert a soul into another vampire\u2019s corpse (before it crumbles to ash), the necromancer must achieve five successes on a resisted ^Willpower^ roll against the original owner of the body. Otherwise, the interloper is denied entrance.<br>Note: The soul can use whatever physical abilities (Athletics, Brawl, Potence) his new fleshy home possesses, and whatever mental abilities (Computer, Law, Presence) he already possessed. He cannot use the physical abilities of his old form, or the mental abilities of his new one."}, {"ID":"4","Name":"The Cenotaph Path","IsAssam":"0","IsKoldu":"0","IsNecro":"1","IsThaum":"0","Descr":"Practitioners of the Cenotaph Path are primarily concerned with discovering or forging links between the living world and the Shadowlands. It functions on the principle that a Kindred, already a corpse, is an unnatural bridge between the living and the dead, and the necromancer can use this to find other, similar linkages. The basic rudiments of the Cenotaph Path function easily enough once the Kindred learns to attune himself to these connections. Advanced mastery of the path usually entails some brief ritual to forge artificial connections, either through focusing unsavory passions or commanding this world and the Shadowlands together.","Level1":"<b>A Touch of Death<\/b><br>Just as a necromancer may exert mastery over the Shadowlands, so too can some ghosts exert themselves in the mortal world. Whereas obvious displays of ghostly power such as bleeding walls or disembodied moans certainly won\u2019t be mistaken, some ghostly abilities exert subtle effects that aren\u2019t easily recognized. A necromancer sensitized to the residue of the dead, though, can feel whether an object has been touched by a ghost or sense the recent passage of a wraith.<br><b>System<\/b>: The necromancer simply touches a person or object that he suspects is a victim of ghostly influence. The player rolls ^Perception + Awareness^ (difficulty 6). If successful, the necromancer can determine whether a ghost has exerted any sort of power on the subject, or even crossed nearby, to the duration detailed below.<br><table><tr><th>Successes<\/th><th>Result<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>1 success<\/td><td>Last turn; detect use of ghostly powers<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2 successes<\/td><td>Last three turns; detect use of ghostly powers<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3 successes<\/td><td>Last hour; detect ghost\u2019s touch and use of ghostly powers<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4 successes<\/td><td>Last day; detect ghost\u2019s touch and use of ghostly powers<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5 successes<\/td><td>Last week; detect nearby passage of ghost, ghost\u2019s touch, and use of ghostly powers<\/td><\/tr><\/table>On a failure, the necromancer receives no impressions. A botch reveals a misleading answer (an object may seem tinged with ghostly power when it\u2019s not, or vice versa). Should the necromancer succeed in detection while touching an object or person that a ghost is possessing, he immediately becomes aware that the ghost is still inside. The impression gained in such a case is sufficient to count as an image of the spirit for purposes of the Sepulchre Path\u2019s powers, so the Kindred may be able to (for example) immediately command a ghost to exit a person whom it possesses.","Level2":"<b>Reveal the Catene<\/b><br>Necromantic compulsions function much more effectively when the caster uses an object of significance to the ghost in question. Such fetters tie the dead to the living lands through their remembered importance - a favored recliner for relaxing, a reviled piece of art foisted off by hated relatives, or some object of similarly intense emotion. Many necromancers can detect such catene through the use of rituals (see Ritual of the Unearthed Fetter, p. 181). With this power, though, the necromancer can determine a fetter with just a few moments of handling. The Kindred simply runs his hands over the object and concentrates on it. He quickly receives an impression of the item\u2019s (or person\u2019s) importance to wraiths, if any; should the wraith be one known to the necromancer, he immediately recognizes the object as a fetter to that (or those) ghost(s). Successful identification of a connected ghost is not exclusive; that is, if the vampire determines that the object is important to a given wraith, he can also determine if there are other ghosts tied to the item, though he must use the power again to gain their identities. Many necromancers use this power on objects already identified with A Touch of Death, in order to determine whether the ghost is trying to attune a given fetter or simply toying with the world of the living.<br><b>System<\/b>: The necromancer holds and examines the object for at least three turns - if it\u2019s an item, this means turning it over in his hands, running his fingers along it, or otherwise giving it a critical eye; with a person, this may require a more... invasive... examination. The player then spends a blood point and rolls ^Perception + Occult^ (difficulty 7). If successful, the Kindred determines whether the object holds any significance to any ghost and, with three or more successes, the identity of at least one such ghost (which allows the Kindred to use the Sepulchre Path on that wraith, if desired). If the necromancer already knows any of the ghosts involved, their ties are revealed with their identity - so, if the necromancer already knows a wraith well enough to summon and compel it with other powers, successful identification of a fetter tells whether the object is tied to that ghost, in addition to any other impressions gained.<br>If a botch is scored, the necromancer can never successfully use this power on the item being examined.","Level3":"<b>Tread Upon the Grave<\/b><br>The extended awareness granted with the Cenotaph Path allows the necromancer to find locations where the Shadowlands and the living world come close. Often, the necromancer experiences a chill or shiver when stepping into an area where the Underworld lies near the living one. With practice, the vampire can tell exactly where such locations are.<br>Experienced necromancers learn that certain locations are susceptible to ghostly influence; these haunted areas often become homes of a sort for ghosts. A knowledgeable vampire can thus discover places where the dead are likely to congregate, the better to snare them with other Necromancy powers.<br><b>System<\/b>: The player simply declares intent to sense the Shroud in an area and makes a ^Willpower^ roll (difficulty 8). Success reveals whether the location is highly attuned to the Shadowlands, about average (not particularly close to the world of the dead), or far removed from the realm of death. A failing attempt at using the power has no adverse effect, though it may be attempted only once per scene (so the necromancer must either wait for a time or move to a different area before attempting Tread Upon the Grave once more).<br>A botch stuns the necromancer into inaction for a full turn and costs him a temporary Willpower point, as he is overcome by shivers and a sense of overwhelming despair.<br>With three or more successes, the necromancer can determine whether the Shroud\u2019s strength has been artificially altered in the area.","Level4":"<b>Death Knell<\/b><br>Not all who die go on to become ghosts - many lack the drive to hang on after death or simply have no overwhelming needs that compel them to stick around. Normally, even necromancers have no way to sort those who might become ghosts from the masses who go on to whatever rewards await. Over time, though, a necromancer can become sensitized to the pull that occurs when a soul escapes from a body only to hover in wait, enslaved by its desires. The weight of desperation becomes like a tangible tug, and some necromancers savor this emotion even as they follow the sensation to find the new ghost. Of course, actually discovering the new ghost can be problematic. The Kindred may need some means to see through the Shroud or may have to send other wraiths to look for the new unfortunate, especially if a large accident or massacre leaves too many corpses for the necromancer to easily discern and test names.<br><b>System<\/b>: Whenever someone dies and becomes a ghost within a half-mile or kilometer of the necromancer, she automatically senses the demise (though many choose to ignore this \u201calways-on\u201d power unless actively seeking someone). This power does not automatically pinpoint the location of the new ghost or identify it, but the player may spend one Willpower point and roll ^Perception + Occult^ (difficulty 7) for the necromancer to gain a vague sense of the distance and direction to the new wraith. With one success, the Kindred may sense a vague pull in a general direction; with three successes, the necromancer can sense the direction and guess distance to within a quarter-mile or half a kilometer. With five successes, the necromancer immediately senses the location of the new ghost to within one foot or 30 cm. A failure carries no penalty but a botched attempt sends the necromancer scurrying off in the wrong direction.<br>The Storyteller may rule that disturbances in the Underworld, intervening magic, or other similar phenomena cloud this sensation, simply to prevent overburdening a chronicle with constant ghost-hunting and dice rolling.","Level5":"<b>Ephemeral Binding<\/b><br>The most puissant necromancers learn not only to sense the ties between living and dead, but to forge such ties themselves. The master of Ephemeral Binding turns an otherwise mundane object or person into a depository for his own necromantic energy. The undying Curse transforms the subject into a sort of linkage between the living and dead. The necromancer smears his blood on the item in question, which mystically absorbs the vitae and, in doing so, becomes a vessel to anchor a spirit.<br><b>System<\/b>: The necromancer must coat an object with his blood (a full blood point\u2019s worth); if the subject is a person, then that individual must ingest the vitae. The player marks off the blood point, spends a point of Willpower, and rolls ^Manipulation + Occult^ (difficulty 8). If successful, the item temporarily becomes a fetter to one wraith. If the Kindred already knows the name of the wraith or has a strong psychic impression, then the object can become a fetter at any range, even to a ghost who normally does not come near the living world (so long as the ghost still exists). Otherwise, the necromancer must be able to see or sense the ghost (with Witness of Death, Shroudsight, or other such means).<br>A fetter artificially created in this fashion functions for all necromantic and ghostly purposes as a normal fetter: It can be detected with other Necromancy powers, the vampire gains a bonus to Necromancy against the wraith attuned to it, and the ghost similarly finds exertion of its powers easier upon the subject (so the vampire might turn an unwitting ghoul into a consort for a wraith familiar with possession...). The ghost can sink into the fetter to heal; conversely, if the fetter is destroyed, the wraith is banished to some inaccessible region of the Underworld, perhaps never to return.<br>A fetter created with Ephemeral Binding lasts for one night per success scored. The expenditure of an additional point of Willpower increases this duration to a week per success, whereas spending a permanent dot of Willpower extends the duration to a year and a day. Botching with this power not only causes failure but also makes the ghost immediately aware of what the necromancer was trying to do. Most ghosts do not take kindly to meddling Kindred trying to make artificial chains for them."}, {"ID":"5","Name":"The Corpse in the Monster","IsAssam":"0","IsKoldu":"0","IsNecro":"1","IsThaum":"0","Descr":"This path enhances the necromantic understanding of the unliving form and allows the user to fully experience the corpse as a gateway between life and death. The path lets the vampire apply some of a corpse\u2019s traits to a vampire, and she can enhance or reduce these traits at various levels of the power.","Level1":"<b>Masque of Death<\/b><br>The character with this ability can assume a visage of death or inflict that shape on another vampire. The victim\u2019s flesh becomes pallid and thin (if it is not already), and skin pulls tight against bone. This ability can be very useful, as it allows one to hide in plain sight in a tomb or crypt at any time (though the character remains as vulnerable to sunlight and fire as ever). When a necromancer uses this power on another Kindred, the victim gains the same corpselike demeanor. In this sense, the ability works as something of a minor curse.<br><b>System<\/b>: The player spends one blood point for the character to gain the form described. Those afflicted with the Masque of Death lose two points of Dexterity and Appearance (minimum of 1 in Dexterity and 0 in Appearance) for the duration of the power. The player also gets two extra dice to his Intimidation dice pool, should he wish to terrify any onlookers. Further, if the character remains perfectly still, observers must roll five successes on a Perception + Medicine roll (difficulty 7) to distinguish the character from a normal corpse. The player doesn\u2019t need to roll anything to have the character stop moving - vampires have no autonomic functions.<br>If the user inflicts Masque of Death on another vampire, he must spend a blood point, touch the target, and then make a ^Stamina + Medicine^ roll (difficulty equal to the target\u2019s Stamina + 3). The Masque of Death lasts until the next sunset, unless the character who created the masque wishes to extinguish its effects earlier.","Level2":"<b>Cold of the Grave<\/b><br>The dead feel no pain, though most undead do. With this ability, the character can temporarily take on the unfeeling semblance of the dead, in order to protect herself from physical and emotional harm. When assuming the Cold of the Grave, the vampire\u2019s skin becomes unusually cold. When she speaks, her breath mists even in warm air - those with exceptional senses might even see a slight red tinge to the breath. The power brings a sense of lethargy over the character, as a mortal might feel under the influence of a mildly unpleasant disease. It becomes difficult to rouse oneself to action, and very little seems important enough to really worry about. A corpse has no worries, after all.<br><b>System<\/b>: The player spends one Willpower point. For the remainder of the scene, the character takes no wound penalties, and the player gains an additional die to all dice pools that involve resisting emotional manipulation, such as Intimidation or Empathy. However, the player also loses a die from dice pools to emotionally manipulate others. The character is a cold fish to those she interacts with, and they do not respond readily to her. The Cold of the Grave does not protect the character against the depredations of the Beast. She may be emotionally cold on the surface, but if others taunt and anger her sufficiently, she is still subject to frenzy as normal.","Level3":"<b>Curse of Life<\/b><br>The Curse of Life inflicts some of the undesirable traits of the living upon the undead, removing their corpselike nature and creating a false life to remind them of the worst things about being alive. Targets of this power regain only the unpleasant aspects of life, as culled from the memory of the Discipline\u2019s user. This may include mundane hunger and thirst, sweat and other excretions, the need to urinate and defecate, a decrease in sensory acuity, and a particular vulnerability to attacks that the character might normally shrug off.<br><b>System<\/b>: The player spends one Willpower and rolls ^Intelligence + Medicine^ (difficulty 8) to affect a target within line of sight and no farther than 20 yards or meters from the character. If the roll succeeds, the target suffers the weaknesses of the living without gaining any benefit from that state. He does not become immune to sunlight or holy artifacts, for instance. However, he does become badly distracted by mundane needs, with the net result that his player suffers a +2 difficulty penalty to all rolls. He can ignore these distractions at the cost of one Willpower point per scene. Additionally, the victim cannot use blood to raise his Physical Attributes while this power is in effect, and Willpower cannot eliminate this penalty. The power remains in effect until the next sunset.","Level4":"<b>Gift of the Corpse<\/b><br>This power, one of the most potent on the Corpse in the Monster path, enables a necromancer to ignore most of her race\u2019s inherent weaknesses for a short time. A dead body is not particularly vulnerable to sunlight, holy artifacts, frenzy, or being staked through the heart, after all, and so it is with a vampire using the Gift of the Corpse. As with the Cold of the Grave, above, the character using this power takes on an even more deathlike mien. It lasts for less than a minute, typically, but that time may be enough to enable a character to charge through a burning building without fearing frenzy or instant death.<br><b>System<\/b>: The player spends one Willpower and rolls ^Stamina + Occult^ (difficulty 8). For every success, the character can spend one turn in a state in which he is more akin to an animated corpse than a vampire. Holy artifacts and sanctified ground have no effect, and the character is immune to frenzy and R\u00f6tschreck. Sunlight does only bashing damage, and then only if bare skin is exposed on a clear day. Being staked through the heart is only as much of a danger as getting stabbed through his dead spleen would be. Fire harms him only as it would a mortal - causing lethal damage instead of aggravated.<br>Should the character end the power\u2019s duration while exposed to any of the aforementioned harmful things, he immediately takes their full effect. If he is staked, he become immobilized; if he is on or near fire, he begins to take the damage a Cainite should take, and he must immediately roll against R\u00f6tschreck.","Level5":"<b>Gift of Life<\/b><br>With the Gift of Life, the character can experience the best and most positive things about being alive. The overwhelming hunger for blood temporarily abates, allowing the character to consume and enjoy food and drink. She can also enjoy sex as she wishes, and the sun does not burn her. The Gift of Life comes with a dark, terrible cost, however. Its use is almost sure to result in the death of a mortal, as the vampire must expend an enormous quantity of vitae in order to initiate it. The Discipline\u2019s effects last until the midnight after the character uses the power, so it is in her best interests to use it just after midnight.<br><b>System<\/b>: The player spends 12 blood points, burning as much blood as possible each turn until she meets that level. She then rolls ^Stamina + Occult^ (difficulty 6) and needs only one success for the power to work. A botch has catastrophic effects. The character might be instantly killed or might inadvertently Embrace her victim, for example. If it takes longer than one turn to spend the necessary blood to enact this ability, it does not take effect until all 12 points have been spent. However, the blood must be spent continuously - the vampire cannot burn five, run off and feed, then burn seven more an hour later. On the other hand, she may feed as she activates the power - in one turn she might burn one blood point while drinking three. Since few Kindred above the Seventh Generation can easily expend such an amount of blood, the most efficient way to activate this power is to have a human nearby who can be sacrificed to power the transformation.<br>After her transformation, the character gains many traits of an ordinary human. She is largely immune to the scorching effects of the sun (Fortitude difficulties to soak damage from direct sunlight are halved, and she takes no damage if she is sufficiently covered), and she can experience and enjoy many of the fine things about human life. She retains a few of her vampiric benefits, however. Fortitude and Auspex abilities remain in place if she has either of those Disciplines, and the Storyteller may allow her to retain other Disciplines as well if he deems them dramatically appropriate. She also retains a vampire\u2019s benefits when it comes to handling bashing damage. However, she is still vulnerable to holy artifacts, human faith, and being staked. Her blood remains vitae, not human blood. Use of this ability - which creates a mockery of human life - may interfere with a character\u2019s Path advancement, at the Storyteller\u2019s discretion.<br>The vampire is no more vulnerable to fire than any other mortal while in this half-alive state, but she still suffers somewhat from the Beast. Frenzy and R\u00f6tschreck difficulties are halved (round up). She can remain active during the day without Humanity or Path-based dice pool caps, although she is certainly tired during the day, since that is not her usual time of activity. Her Beast exacts a dangerous retribution when her day of \u201clife\u201d is done. Although its influence is greatly suppressed during this power\u2019s duration, the Beast has its way with the vampire for the next six nights, as all difficulties to resist frenzy increase by three. The wise necromancer hides herself away somewhere during that period, but, depending on morality and temperament, enforced isolation might drive her to frenzy on its own."}, {"ID":"6","Name":"The Grave\u2019s Decay","IsAssam":"0","IsKoldu":"0","IsNecro":"1","IsThaum":"0","Descr":"This path is derived from the observation of the working of time on all things mortal. Stone crumbles and the corpse rots away to nothing, a process of endless fascination to the lost Cainites known as Cappadocians. Indeed, for the undying, the process of decay is a fascinating disease that afflicts everyone and everything save them. Under this path, a practitioner of Necromancy channels that force.","Level1":"<b>Destroy the Husk<\/b><br>Cainites who kill their victims, rather than just feeding upon them, frequently find themselves in need of a quick way to dispose of a corpse. While there are many ways to make sure that a corpse is not found - feed it to a pack of hounds or weigh it down and throw it in a river - many of these methods do involve risk to the vampire and are not guaranteed to succeed. Destroy the Husk, by contrast, is foolproof. Use of this power simply turns one human corpse to a pile of about 30 pounds (13 kilograms) of unremarkable dust, roughly the size and shape of that body.<br><b>System<\/b>: The player spends one blood point as the vampire drips her vitae onto the corpse. The player then rolls ^Intelligence + Medicine^ (difficulty 6). One success is all that is needed to render the corpse into dust, although the process takes a number of turns equal to five minus the successes.","Level2":"<b>Rigor Mortis<\/b><br>One of the first changes that comes over a dead body is rigidity; the corpse becomes stiff as a board, frozen in a single pose. The Cainite who wields Rigor Mortis is able to push a living or undead body to that frozen point using only his will and understanding of the forces of decay. She forces her target to become rigid and unable to move without enormous effort of will, as his very muscles betray him.<br><b>System<\/b>: The player spends a point of Willpower and rolls ^Intelligence + Medicine^ (difficulty 7). Each success freezes the target in place for one turn. A failure simply indicates the loss of the Willpower point, while a botch renders the target immune to powers in the Grave\u2019s Decay path for the next 24 hours. The target must be visible and within about 25 yards or meters for this ability to take effect. A frozen target is treated as though he has been staked (see p. 280). With a Willpower roll (difficulty 7) and two successes, the target can break out of the rigor on her turn. Failure causes her a level of bashing damage and means another turn wasted and frozen.","Level3":"<b>Wither<\/b><br>Reminiscent of some of the powers of Vicissitude, Wither allows a vampire to cripple an opponent\u2019s limb. Whether the foe is living or undead, muscle shrivels away, skin peels, and bone becomes brittle. The target is unable to exert any noteworthy strength in the crippled limb. This injury lasts for far longer than most injuries trouble vampires, and in mortals it simply does not heal.<br>Wither doesn\u2019t have to be used on a limb, although that is its usual purpose. It can also be used simply to affect the target\u2019s face and hair, making him appear far older than his years. It could also be applied to a target\u2019s eye or ear, killing the sense in that organ (and thus requiring two uses to permanently blind or deafen). Wither cannot be used as an \u201cinstant-kill\u201d power - necromancers cannot wither internal organs - but it can inflict a wide variety of injuries on a foe.<br><b>System<\/b>: The player spends a Willpower point. The character chooses a limb on the target and then touches that limb. If the target is trying to avoid contact, the invoker\u2019s player rolls ^Dexterity + Brawl^ to hit as normal. If the character succeeds in touching the intended limb, the target suffers two aggravated wounds. Unless the target soaks both wounds (such as with Fortitude), the struck limb is crippled and unusable until both of those wounds have healed. Kindred heal the wounds as they would any other aggravated wound (see p. 285).<br>Mortals are incapable of healing aggravated wounds, so they suffer throughout their lives unless they are healed through supernatural means. A withered limb does not degenerate further, even on a mortal. The character may be crippled for life, but the limb won\u2019t become infected or gangrenous.<br>The effects of the withering depend on the affected limb. A crippled arm has a Strength of 0, cannot benefit from Potence, and cannot carry anything heavier than about half a pound (200 grams). A crippled leg prevents the character from moving faster than a stuttering hop or dragging limp. The character suffers the effects of the Lame Flaw (see p. 482). A single withered eye or ear imposes a +1 difficulty to relevant Perception rolls. Losing both eyes or both ears imposes the effects of the Blind or Deaf Flaws (see pp. 484 and 483). A withered tongue imposes the effects of the Mute Flaw (p. 483), while a withered face reduces the target\u2019s Appearance by one for each aggravated wound suffered.","Level4":"<b>Corrupt the Undead Flesh<\/b><br>Corrupt the Undead Flesh blurs the line between life and undeath, turning an undead creature into something just living enough to carry and suffer from disease. The disease inflicts the target, causing lethargy, dizziness, loss of strength, clumsiness, and the inability to keep blood in his system. This pernicious influence is extremely virulent among mortals. They pick the disease up simply by spending a few hours near the victim. Other vampires have a harder time acquiring the disease. They must consume the victim\u2019s blood to do so, but afterward, they suffer just as much as the original target - including passing the affliction on to others. The disease fades after roughly a week.<br><b>System<\/b>: The player chooses a target within her character\u2019s line of sight and no more than 20 yards or meters away. She rolls ^Intelligence + Medicine^ (difficulty 6) and spends a point of Willpower. The victim\u2019s player must roll Stamina (+ Fortitude, if appropriate) against a difficulty equal to the attacker\u2019s Willpower. If the player scores more successes than the victim, he acquires a virulent disease immediately. The disease has the following effects:<br> 1. The victim\u2019s Strength and Wits are halved (round down).<br> 2. The victim loses one point of Dexterity.<br> 3. The victim\u2019s player must spend one additional blood point every evening for the vampire to rouse himself to consciousness. Mortals lose one health level per day instead.<br> 4. The victim\u2019s player must roll Self-Control or Instinct each time the character feeds (difficulty 8). On a failure, the vampire cannot keep the blood he just ingested inside his body, and he vomits it up in great horrifying gouts of gore, losing any benefit the blood might have provided. Humans vomit up food.<br>Every evening at sunset, the victim has a chance to throw off the plague. The victim\u2019s player rolls Stamina, with a difficulty equal to 10 minus the number of sunsets since acquiring the plague. On a successful roll, the character fights the disease to a standstill and begins to recover. He instantly regains his ability to manage blood, and he heals back one lost Attribute point per hour until all have returned.","Level5":"<b>Dissolve the Flesh<\/b><br>This ability brings the Grave\u2019s Decay path full circle, as it causes Destroy the Husk to apply to vampires. Dissolve the Flesh allows a necromancer to attempt to turn vampiric flesh to dust or ash, as though the target had been burned or left out in the sun.<br><b>System<\/b>: The player spends two blood points and a Willpower point as the vampire extracts a quantity of her vitae charged with the power of the grave. If she drips it onto a single Kindred victim anytime within the next few turns (most of the blood must reach the victim, so flinging a few drops is ineffective), it causes whole chunks of the victim\u2019s body to crumble to ash. The player rolls ^Willpower^ against a difficulty of the victim\u2019s Stamina + 3. For every success, the target takes one aggravated wound.<br>The undead flesh damaged by this power turns to dust (gone for the time being), and it must be regenerated painstakingly by the victim, should he survive. That dust doubtlessly has mystical properties that various sorcerers might be able to take advantage of. Every wound inflicted by this ability represents the loss of about one-eighth of the target\u2019s weight; the Storyteller chooses where the loss comes from. (It might also be shed from all over, leaving the victim a bit gaunter or missing chunks of flesh.) Regenerating body parts occurs naturally while healing aggravated wounds at the normal rate (see p. 285)."}, {"ID":"7","Name":"Path of the Four Humors","IsAssam":"0","IsKoldu":"0","IsNecro":"1","IsThaum":"0","Descr":"Philosophically, the four humors represent different qualities, split along two axes: hot and cold, and wet and dry. Blood is hot and wet; phlegm is cold and wet; yellow bile is hot and dry; and black bile is cold and dry. Historically, when a mortal was out of sorts or ill, it was said that his humors were out of balance, and a philosopher or physician would try to heal him by bringing his humors back into balance. Ancient necromancers believed that in their undead forms, all four humors were held in a mystical stasis, and that they could tap into all four of them instead of merely tapping into blood in the form of vitae as other vampires did.<br>This antiquated path was primarily considered the knowledge of the Lamia bloodline, and certainly very few necromancers have learned this path without tutoring from a Lamia. Since the loss of the Lamia, elder necromancers have searched everywhere (both in this world and the next) for clues to its existence.","Level1":"<b>Whispers to the Soul<\/b><br>The necromancer with this ability can let slip a little of her own undead bilious humor as she speaks to another being (whether mortal or Kindred). The wicked vapor slips into the target\u2019s ear and whispers nightmares to the target throughout the day and night. The target has a harder time sleeping, and becomes irritable and distracted during his waking hours.<br><b>System<\/b>: The character must whisper the target\u2019s name (as she knows it) into his ear. The victim rolls Willpower (difficulty 8). If the roll fails, the victim suffers from nightmares and hears mad, wicked mutterings while awake, for a number of full days equal to the necromancer\u2019s Manipulation. The victim loses one die from all dice pools while thus afflicted, and at the Storyteller\u2019s discretion, the difficulty to resist R\u00f6tschreck may be increased by one at the same time.","Level2":"<b>Kiss of the Dark Mother<\/b><br>Kiss of the Dark Mother allows the necromancer who uses it to mix her vitae with black bile, turning it into a noxious poison. The necromancer forces it into her mouth as saliva might once have come; the vitae tastes acrid and bitter, as though it had been scorched. Once the necromancer coats her teeth and lips with it, she can inflict terrible damage with her bite.<br><b>System<\/b>: The player spends one blood point; activating this power is a reflexive action, but it must be done before making a bite attack. If the bite hits, the aggravated damage inflicted by a single bite is doubled before soak is calculated. This power does not affect the character\u2019s ability to drain blood from the target, nor does it increase the amount of damage done by blood loss. The necromancer\u2019s bite remains potent until this ability is discharged by a successful hit or she spends one turn cleansing the dark blood from her mouth.","Level3":"<b>Dark Humors<\/b><br>The vampire can exude a coat of a particular humor onto her skin, causing all that touch it to experience the most intense form of that humor. After a necromancer has used this power, she generally feels the opposite of the sensation the humor usually conveys: Using blood leaves her depressed and pessimistic; using yellow bile renders her calm and placid; using black bile leaves her optimistic; and using phlegm makes her aroused and angry.<br><b>System<\/b>: The player spends two blood points. The necromancer chooses which humor she wishes to excrete. The humor can simply coat the skin - in which case touching the victim\u2019s skin lets the humor take effect - or it can act as a poison if placed in a beverage (or in vitae). The victim must make a Stamina roll (difficulty 8) to resist the effects of the humor:<br> 1. Phlegm: Target becomes lethargic; all dice pools are reduced by two for the remainder of the scene.<br> 2. Blood (vitae): Target becomes prone to excessive bleeding, and any lethal or aggravated wounds he suffers deal an additional health level of damage on the turn after they originally occur. Vitae altered by Dark Humors will not turn a human into a ghoul if ingested, nor will it initiate a blood bond.<br> 3. Black Bile: Target suffers a number of health levels of damage equal to the necromancer\u2019s Stamina. This damage is considered lethal and can be soaked (if the victim is normally capable of soaking such damage), though armor does not protect against it.<br> 4. Yellow Bile: Target becomes melancholic and is plagued with visions of death. He cannot spend Willpower for the remainder of the scene, and all Willpower rolls receive a +2 difficulty.","Level4":"<b>Clutching the Shroud<\/b><br>Blood, the sanguine humor, was regarded by philosophers as being both hot and wet. Blood from a cold corpse has been transubstantiated into a dead form - a cold incarnation of a hot, wet element. This transformation of the living into death holds great power; the necromancer knows how to infuse her own being with the blood of a cold corpse and transform herself into something not wholly vampiric. Instead, the necromancer edges closer to being an animated corpse in fact as well as name. She grows distant and chill, as though possessed by the spirit of Death itself; she has to work to push her attention into the physical world.<br><b>System<\/b>: The character must drink, and then spend, five blood points from a cold corpse (one dead for 24 hours or more, but generally less than three days). It will generally take at least two turns to consume that blood, and the power is not activated until the character can spend all of it. For example, if the character is Twelfth Generation, Clutching the Shroud takes at least seven turns total to activate (two to consume the blood and five to spend it).<br>After the power is active and for the rest of the scene, the necromancer gains several benefits. First, she receives two additional soak dice, which may be used to soak any sort of damage, even if the character does not possess Fortitude. Second, she gains a mystic sense of how far those in the area are from death - whether they are healthy or infirm, suffer from diseases, or are undead, ghouls, or mortals. Finally, a ^Manipulation + Occult^ roll lets her speak with ghosts freely. The difficulty for this roll depends on how attuned to death a locale is; a cemetery would be difficulty 5, while a cozy apartment might be difficulty 7. However, this ability makes the necromancer much more susceptible to the effects of powers used by ghosts, which means that she must act carefully.","Level5":"<b>Black Breath<\/b><br>A necromancer who has mastered this path can harness the undead black bile that festers at the core of her being; she pulls that melancholy to her lungs and lets it mingle with her outgoing breath. She then exhales the dark mist, letting it engulf those nearby. The necromancer feels curiously lightheaded and optimistic after using this power, as she has forced some of her most depressed nature out into the world; those caught in the black vapors grow despairing and hopeless.<br><b>System<\/b>: The player spends one Willpower and one blood point, and rolls ^Stamina + Athletics^ (difficulty 7). Black Breath allows the character to exhale a dark cloud of vapor that is five yards or meters in diameter per success rolled. Those caught in the mists may attempt a Dexterity + Athletics roll to escape it if they have an available action; otherwise, they may be overwhelmed by depression to the point of suicide. Those who cannot escape the mists must immediately roll Willpower (difficulty 8 for mortals, 7 for supernatural beings) and achieve more successes than the invoker did. Mortals who fail in this actively attempt to kill themselves on their next turn. They do not attempt such ludicrous suicides as praying for a lightning bolt or holding their breath; they use the most effective means at hand to end their own lives. If prevented from suicide, they attempt it again as soon as an opportunity presents itself. This impulse lasts for the rest of the scene, and the Storyteller may impose flare-ups over the next day or so at his discretion. Those who succeed on the Willpower roll still become enchanted with the prospect of death, whether mortal or Kindred, and lose two dice from all dice pools for the rest of the scene.<br>Kindred who fail the Willpower roll do not attempt suicide; as they are already dead, the malign influences of undead humors do not have as strong an effect on them. Instead, the affected vampire sinks into torpor. The duration of this torpor is based on the vampire\u2019s Humanity or Path rating, just as if lethal wounds had forced him into it."}, {"ID":"8","Name":"Vitreous Path","IsAssam":"0","IsKoldu":"0","IsNecro":"1","IsThaum":"0","Descr":"The Vitreous Path allows a necromancer to control and influence the energies pertaining to death. This extremely rare path manipulates entropy, a force that even most necromancers are uncomfortable harnessing. A development of the Nagaraja bloodline (p. 406, although they sometimes call the path \u201cNihilistics\u201d), the Vitreous Path makes a formidable complement to the necromantic craft, and those obsessed with mastery over death and souls - such as the Harbingers of Skulls - would certainly risk much to uncover this path\u2019s secrets. Like most necromancers, Nagaraja generally learn the Sepulchre Path before any others. The Vitreous Path is usually their second focus of study.","Level1":"<b>Eyes of the Dead<\/b><br>The necromancer employing the Eyes of the Dead can see with the perceptions of the Restless Dead (called Deathsight). To such a manipulator of ghostly energies, the auras of surrounding beings give off telltale hints as to their health and even their ultimate fate; the necromancer can see the energies of death flowing through everyone, just as ghosts can. By looking at the entropic markings on a person\u2019s body, the necromancer can gain rough knowledge of how far that person is from death, how soon that person is likely to die, and even what the cause of her death is likely to be. The information thus gained is not exact by any means, but it gives the necromancer an edge over those she scrutinizes.<br><b>System<\/b>: The player rolls ^Perception + Occult^, difficulty 6. One success lets a necromancer determine whether someone is injured, diseased, or dying, as well as whether the individual labors under any sort of curse or baleful magic.<br>Further, the vampire can divine the target\u2019s eventual demise, depending on the successes scored. One success means the character can guess how long the target has to live to within a few weeks. Three successes means the character can estimate how long the target has to live and what the probable source of death will be, as the entropic markings show the wounds that will someday exist on that person. Five successes means the character can actually see where and when the event will occur by interpreting the black marks on the target\u2019s soul.<br>This ability lasts for one scene, though the necromancer may choose to end the power early. It can be used to read the fate of only one target at a time. Storytellers should exercise judgment with this power, since the markings of death are typically unavoidable. He may decide to roll the dice himself, so that the player has no way of knowing whether her insight is correct.","Level2":"<b>Aura of Decay<\/b><br>The necromancer can strengthen the feeling of entropy around her to the point where it breaks down nonliving objects and machines. It can gnarl wood, rust metal, crack silicon chips, and erode plastic, glass, and dead organic material. This power has a range of one yard or meter from the necromancer\u2019s body, but all those in the presence of the vampire can feel her corruption as an icy wind.<br><b>System<\/b>: No roll is required, but this power does cost at least one blood point. Objects subjected to this Aura of Decay break down and become useless after being targeted. How the object gives out, as well as the exact mechanism of failure, is up to the Storyteller. Corrosion, metal fatigue, or sheer brittleness are all suitably likely for any given item\u2019s demise, but the in-game effect of using a doomed item is as if the owning character rolled a botch. The speed at which an item breaks down depends on how many blood points are spent.<br><table><tr><th>Blood Spent<\/th><th>Time to Breakdown<\/th><tr><tr><td>One<\/td><td>One week<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Two<\/td><td>One day<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Three<\/td><td>End of scene<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Four<\/td><td>Five turns<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Five<\/td><td>One turn<\/td><\/tr><table><br>Note that since this power requires the expenditure of blood points, a character cannot cause an Aura of Decay while staked.","Level3":"<b>Soul Feast<\/b><br>Just as the necromancer can release entropic energies from within, she may also pull them into herself as a source of power. Soul Feasting allows the caster to either draw on the ambient death energies around her or to actively feed on a ghost, stealing the wraith\u2019s substance and mystically transforming that energy into sustenance.<br><b>System<\/b>: The player spends one Willpower point to allow the vampire to feed on the negative energies of the dead. If the character is drawing the energies from the atmosphere, she must be in a place where death has occurred within the hour or in a place where death is common, such as a cemetery, a morgue, or the scene of a recent murder. Generally, the necromancer can draw anywhere from one to four points of entropy from such a location, although the difficulty in using all Necromancy and similar deathly powers within the area increases by an equal amount for a number of nights equal to the points taken. The energies of such an area may only be drained once until the area\u2019s entropy replenishes.<br>In cases when the necromancer feeds on a ghost, the vampire must actually attack the wraith as if feeding normally. Wraiths have up to 10 \u201cblood points\u201d that may be taken from them, and they become less and less substantial as their spirit essence drains away. The character is vulnerable to any attack the ghost might make, even those that do not normally affect the physical world; while feeding, the vampire is essentially in a half-state, existing in both the living lands and the Underworld simultaneously. The wraith so attacked is considered immobilized and cannot run or escape unless it can defeat the vampire in a resisted ^Willpower^ roll (difficulty 6 for both sides). This power may also be used in conjunction with Ash Path Necromancy, allowing the vampire to drain power (though not sustenance) from ghosts while traveling in the lands of the dead.<br>This soul energy may be used just like blood in every respect except for when the vampire rises for the night. It can activate Disciplines, heal wounds, boost Attributes, etc. Botching this power renders the vampire unable to feed through the Shroud for the rest of the night. However, she remains susceptible to the assaults of ghosts and spirits for several turns (generally, a number of turns equal to the amount of energy that could have been drawn from the area, or one turn if attacking a ghost) as she hovers between worlds, unable to function effectively in either.","Level4":"<b>Breath of Thanatos<\/b><br>The Breath of Thanatos allows the necromancer to draw out entropic energy and focus it upon an area or person by taking a deep breath and then forcefully exhaling a fog of necromantic energy. This cloud of virulence is completely invisible to anyone without the ability to see the passing of entropy. The energy of this cloud is like a beacon for Spectres, and they are drawn to the entropic force like moths to a flame.<br>Once the energy is pulled from the necromancer\u2019s body, she can either disperse it over a large area as a lure for Spectres, or use the mist for more sinister purposes. Channeled into an object or person, the deathmist inflicts the subject with a debilitating, wasting illness. Furthermore, the focused energies are tainted and eerie, and though generally invisible (except to powers such as Aura Perception), they tend to cause people and animals to feel uncomfortable around the victim.<br><b>System<\/b>: The player spends one blood point and rolls ^Willpower^ (difficulty 8). Only one success is needed to draw out the Breath of Thanatos. If dispersed to summon Spectres, the energies cover roughly one-quarter of a mile (400 meters) in radius, centered around the necromancer. The range increases by an additional one-quarter mile or 400 meters for every additional blood point expended.<br>Spectres summoned with this power will ignore the summoning necromancer for the duration of the power unless provoked, but may well go out of their way to wreak havoc on anyone else in the vicinity. The necromancer can then use other Necromancy powers (such as those in the Sepulchre Path) to manipulate and affect these Spectres. Ghosts so targeted may then interact with the necromancer as normal, although the other Spectres in the area will continue to ignore both the vampire and the targeted ghost. This energy disperses after a scene, after which the Spectres leave to find new prey. Mechanics for Spectres can be found on p. 385.<br>If the cloud is directed toward a particular target, the necromancer must either touch the target or direct the stream of entropy using ^Dexterity + Occult^ (difficulty 7). A target laden with entropy suffers one (and only one) level of aggravated damage; this generally manifests as sudden illness or decay. The target\u2019s social difficulties while interacting with those unfamiliar with the touch of death - most normal humans, as well as some supernatural creatures - increase by 2. Furthermore, supernatural perceptions indicate the target is tainted with decay, which can be dangerous. This form of taint lasts until sunrise; a victim already plagued by this power cannot be affected again until the previous fog of entropy has dispersed.<br>A botch on the roll to control this power indicates that the vampire has turned the energy upon himself, and suffers all the effects of the vitriolic breath. This inflicts the usual injury and may subject the necromancer to the possibly dangerous attention of provoked Spectres and other creatures from beyond the grave.","Level5":"<b>Night Cry<\/b><br>The breath of entropic energy becomes a scream of pure chaos. The necromancer can issue an unearthly cry (heard both in the living world and in the Shadowlands). The howl pours icy oblivion into a target or group of targets - either sweeping away the inherent entropy or collecting that destruction and unleashing it.<br><b>System<\/b>: The vampire chooses a number of targets within one yard or meter per dot of Necromancy and invokes Night Cry with a terrible scream. The player spends a Willpower point and a blood point for each target beyond the first. (In other words, she spends no blood if only going after one target, or one blood for two targets. Generational blood limits apply, and the vampire may not \u201cpre-spend\u201d blood prior to using Night Cry.)<br>The player then chooses whether the vampire will aid or harm the targets, and rolls ^Manipulation + Occult^ (difficulty 6). If she chooses to aid the target or targets, each success gives each affected target a -2 difficulty modifier to all of his actions for one turn per success. If she instead chooses harm, each success causes an aggravated wound to each target. Targets may be any kind of living creature, including supernatural ones.<br>No matter the result, the Night Cry is heard on both sides of the Shroud, attracting the attention of anyone nearby. On a botch, the necromancy may summon unruly ghosts or Spectres, similar to Breath of Thanatos (although the ghosts are under no compulsion to ignore the necromancer...)."}, {"ID":"9","Name":"The Path of Blood","IsAssam":"1","IsKoldu":"0","IsNecro":"0","IsThaum":"1","Descr":"Almost every Tremere studies the Path of Blood as her primary path. It encompasses some of the most fundamental principles of Thaumaturgy, based as it is on the manipulation of Kindred vitae. If a player wishes to select another path as her character\u2019s primary path, the Storyteller may require additional reasoning (though choosing a different path is by no means unheard of).","Level1":"<b>A Taste for Blood<\/b><br>This power was developed as a means of testing a foe\u2019s might - an extremely important ability in the tumultuous early nights of Clan Tremere. By merely touching the blood of his subject, the caster may determine how much vitae remains in the subject and, if the subject is a vampire, how recently he has fed, his approximate Generation and, with three or more successes, whether he has ever committed diablerie.<br><b>System<\/b>: The number of successes achieved on the roll determines how much information the thaumaturge gleans and how accurate it is.","Level2":"<b>Blood Rage<\/b><br>This power allows a vampire to force another Kindred to expend blood against his will. The caster must touch her subject for this power to work, though only the lightest contact is necessary. A vampire affected by this power might feel a physical rush as the thaumaturge heightens his Physical Attributes, might find himself suddenly looking more human, or may even find himself on the brink of frenzy as his stores of vitae are mystically depleted.<br><b>System<\/b>: Each success forces the subject to spend one blood point immediately in the way the caster desires (which must go towards some logical expenditure the target vampire could make, such as increasing Physical Attributes or powering Disciplines). Note that blood points forcibly spent in this manner may exceed the normal \u201cper turn\u201d maximum indicated by the victim\u2019s Generation. Each success gained also increases the subject\u2019s difficulty to resist frenzy by one. The thaumaturge may not use Blood Rage on herself to circumvent generational limits.","Level3":"<b>Blood of Potency<\/b><br>The thaumaturge gains such control over his own blood that he may effectively \u201cconcentrate\u201d it, making it more powerful for a short time. In effect, he may temporarily lower his own Generation with this power. This power may be used only once per night.<br><b>System<\/b>: One success on the Willpower roll allows the character to lower his Generation by one step for one hour. Each additional success grants the Kindred either one step down in Generation or one hour of effect. Successes earned must be spent both to decrease the vampire\u2019s Generation and to maintain the change (this power cannot be activated again until the original application wears off). If the vampire is diablerized while this power is in effect, it wears off immediately and the diablerist gains power appropriate to the caster\u2019s actual Generation. Furthermore, any mortals Embraced by the thaumaturge are born to the Generation appropriate to their sire\u2019s original Generation (e.g., a Tenth-Generation Tremere who has reduced his effective Generation to Eighth still produces Eleventh-Generation childer).<br>Once the effect wears off, any blood over the character\u2019s blood pool maximum dilutes, leaving the character at his regular blood pool maximum. Thus, if a Twelfth-Generation Tremere (maximum blood pool of 11) decreased his Generation to Ninth (maximum blood pool 14), ingested 14 blood points, and had this much vitae in his system when the power wore off, his blood pool would immediately drop to 11.","Level4":"<b>Theft of Vitae<\/b><br>A thaumaturge using this power siphons vitae from her subject. She need never come in contact with the subject - blood literally streams out in a physical torrent from the subject to the Kindred (though it is often mystically absorbed and need not enter through the mouth).<br><b>System<\/b>: The number of successes determines how many blood points the caster transfers from the subject. The subject must be visible to the thaumaturge and within 50 feet (15 meters). Using this power prevents the caster from being blood-bound, but otherwise counts as if the vampire ingested the blood herself. This power is spectacularly obvious, and Camarilla princes justifiably consider its public use a breach of the Masquerade.","Level5":"<b>Cauldron of Blood<\/b><br>A thaumaturge using this power boils her subject\u2019s blood in his veins like water on a stove. The Kindred must touch her subject, and it is this contact that simmers the subject\u2019s blood. This power is always fatal to mortals, and causes great damage to even the mightiest vampires.<br><b>System<\/b>: The number of successes gained determines how many blood points are brought to boil. The subject suffers one health level of aggravated damage for each point boiled (individuals with Fortitude may soak this damage using only their Fortitude dice).

This power cannot be \u201cstacked\u201d - one application must expire before the next can be made.","Level2":"<b>Wooden Tongues<\/b><br>A vampire may speak, albeit in limited fashion, with the spirit of any inanimate object. The conversation may not be incredibly interesting, as most rocks and chairs have limited concern for what occurs around them, but the vampire can get at least a general impression of what the subject has \u201cexperienced\u201d.

An object cannot take an action that would be completely inconceivable for something with its form - for instance, a door could not leap from its hinges and carry someone across a street. However, seemingly solid objects can become flexible within reason: Barstools can run with their legs, guns can twist out of their owners\u2019 hands or fire while holstered, and humanoid statues can move like normal humans.<br><b>System<\/b>: This power requires the expenditure of a Willpower point with less than four successes on the roll.

Objects animated by this power stay animated as long as they are within the caster\u2019s line of sight or up to an hour, although the thaumaturge can take other actions during that time.","Level4":"<b>Elemental Form<\/b><br>The vampire can take the shape of any inanimate object of a mass roughly equal to her own. A desk, a statue, or a bicycle would be feasible, but a house or a pen would be beyond this power\u2019s capacity.<br><b>System<\/b>: The number of successes determines how completely the character takes the shape she wishes to counterfeit.

In addition to providing physical protection from the elements (and even sunlight), the Verdant Haven also establishes a mystical barrier which is nearly impassable to anyone the caster wishes to exclude. A Verdant Haven appears as a six-foot-tall (two-meter-tall) hemisphere of interlocked branches, leaves, and vines with no discernible opening, and even to the casual observer it appears to be an unnatural construction.

The viscous acid corrodes metal, destroys wood, and causes horrendous chemical burns to living tissue.<br><b>System<\/b>: The player spends one blood point to create the acid - the blood literally transmutes into the volatile secretion. One blood point creates enough acid to burn through a quarter-inch or half a centimeter of steel plate or three inches (seven centimeters) of wood.

Failure means the limb is permanently and completely crippled. Partial resistance is possible: One success indicates that the difficulty of any roll involving the use of the arm increases by two, though these effects are still permanent with regard to mortals. Two successes signify that difficulties increase by one. Vampires afflicted by this power may spend five blood points to rejuvenate atrophied limbs. Mortals are permanently crippled.

This injury cannot be soaked (the resistance roll replaces soak for this attack) but can be healed normally. Vampires lose blood points instead of health levels, though if a vampire has no blood points this attack inflicts health level loss as it would against a mortal.

If the roll is successful, control is maintained.

They are uniformly \u201cgeneric\u201d in that each object summoned, if summoned again, would look exactly as it did at first. For example, a knife would be precisely the same knife if created twice; the two would be indistinguishable. Even a specific knife - the one a character\u2019s father used to threaten her - would appear identical every time it was conjured. A rat would have repeated \u201ctiled\u201d patterns over its fur, and a garbage can would have a completely uniform fluted texture over its surface. Additionally, conjured objects bear no flaws: Weapons have no dents or scratches, tools have no distinguishing marks, and cellphones all look like they just came out of their packaging.<br>The limit on the size of conjured objects appears to be that of the conjurer: nothing larger than the thaumaturge can be created. The conjurer must also have some degree of familiarity with the object he wishes to call forth. Simply working from a picture or imagination calls for a higher difficulty, while objects with which the character is intimately familiar (such as the knife described above) may actually lower the difficulty, at the Storyteller\u2019s discretion. When a player rolls to conjure something, the successes gained on the roll indicate the quality of the summoned object. One success yields a shoddy, imperfect creation, while five successes garner the caster a nearly perfect replica.","Level1":"<b>Summon the Simple Form<\/b><br>At this level of mastery, the conjurer may create simple, inanimate objects. The object cannot have any moving parts and may not be made of multiple materials.

One theory holds that its secrets were taught to the Tremere by demons and that use of it brings the practitioner dangerously close to the infernal powers. A second opinion has been advanced that the Path of Corruption is a holdover from the days when Clan Tremere was still mortal. The third theory, and the most disturbing to the Tremere, is that the path originated with the Followers of Set, and that knowledge of its workings was sold to the Tremere for an unspecified price. This last rumor is vehemently denied by the Tremere, which automatically makes it a favorite topic of discussion when the matter comes up.<br>The Path of Corruption is primarily a mentally and spiritually oriented path centered on influencing the psyches of other individuals. It can be used neither to issue commands like Dominate nor to change emotions in the moment like Presence. Rather, it produces a gradual and subtle twisting of the subject\u2019s actions, morals, and thought processes. This path deals intimately with deception and dark desires, and those who work through it must understand the hidden places of the heart. Accordingly, no character may have a higher rating in the Path of Corruption than he has in Subterfuge.","Level1":"<b>Contradict<\/b><br>The vampire can interrupt a subject\u2019s thought processes, forcing the victim to reverse his current course of action. An Archon may be caused to execute a prisoner she was about to exonerate and release; a mortal lover might switch from gentle and caring to sadistic and demanding in the middle of an encounter. The results of Contradict are never precisely known to the thaumaturge in advance, but they always take the form of a more negative action than the subject had originally intended to perform.<br><b>System<\/b>: This power may be used on any subject within the character\u2019s line of sight. The player rolls as per normal. The target rolls Perception + Subterfuge (difficulty equal to the number of successes scored by the caster + 2). Two successes allow the subject to realize that she is being influenced by some outside source.<br>Three successes let her pinpoint the source of the effect. Four successes give her a moment of hesitation, neither performing her original action nor its inverse, while five allow her to carry through with the original action.<br>The Storyteller dictates what the subject\u2019s precise reaction to this power is. Contradict cannot be used in combat or to affect other actions (at the Storyteller\u2019s discretion) that are mainly physical and reflexive.","Level2":"<b>Subvert<\/b><br>This power follows the same principle as does Contradict, the release of a subject\u2019s dark, self-destructive side. However, Subvert\u2019s effects are longer-lasting than the momentary flare of Contradiction. Under the influence of this power, victims act on their own suppressed temptations, pursuing agendas that their morals or self-control would forbid them to follow under normal circumstances.<br><b>System<\/b>: This power requires the character to make eye contact (see p. 152) with the intended victim. The player rolls normally. The target resists with a roll of Perception + Subterfuge (difficulty equal to the target\u2019s ^Manipulation + Subterfuge^).

This power is used to break the social ties of interpersonal relationships. Even the most passionate affair or the oldest friendship can be cooled through use of Dissociate, and weaker personal ties can be destroyed altogether.<br><b>System<\/b>: The character must touch the target. The player rolls normally. The target resists with a Willpower roll (difficulty of the thaumaturge\u2019s ^Manipulation + Empathy^). The victim loses three dice from all Social rolls for a period of time determined by the number of successes gained by the caster:<br><table><tr><th>Successes<\/th><th>Result<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>1 success<\/td><td>Five minutes<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2 successes<\/td><td>One hour<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3 successes<\/td><td>One night<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4 successes<\/td><td>Three nights<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5 successes<\/td><td>One week<\/td><\/tr><\/table>This penalty applies to all rolls that rely on Social Attributes, even those required for the use of Disciplines. If this power is used on a character who has participated in the Vaulderie or a similar ritual, that character\u2019s Vinculum ratings are reduced by three for the duration of Dissociate\u2019s effect.<br>Dissociate\u2019s primary effect falls under roleplaying rather than game mechanics. Victims of this power should be played as withdrawn, suspicious, and emotionally distant. The Storyteller should feel free to require a Willpower point expenditure for a player who does not follow these guidelines.","Level4":"<b>Addiction<\/b><br>This power is a much stronger and more potentially damaging form of Subvert. Addiction creates just that in the victim. By simply exposing the target to a particular sensation, substance, or action, the caster creates a powerful psychological dependence. Many thaumaturges ensure that their victims become addicted to substances or thrills that only the mystic can provide, thus creating both a source of income and potential blackmail material.<br><b>System<\/b>: The subject must encounter or be exposed to the sensation, substance, or action to which the character wants to addict him. The thaumaturge then touches his target. The player rolls normally; the victim resists with a Self-Control\/Instinct roll (difficulty equal to the number of successes scored by the caster + 3). Failure gives the subject an instant addiction to that object.<br>An addicted character must get his fix at least once a night. Every night that he goes without satisfying his desire imposes a cumulative penalty of one die on all of his dice pools (to a minimum pool of one die). The victim must roll Self-Control\/Instinct (difficulty 8) every time he is confronted with the object of his addiction and wishes to keep from indulging. Addiction lasts for a number of weeks equal to the thaumaturge\u2019s Manipulation score.<br>An individual may try to break the effects of Addiction. This requires an extended Self-Control\/Instinct roll (difficulty of the caster\u2019s ^Manipulation + Subterfuge^), with one roll made per night. The addict must accumulate a number of successes equal to three times the number of successes scored by the caster. The victim may not indulge in his addiction over the time needed to accumulate these successes. If he does so, all accumulated successes are lost and he must begin anew on the next night. Note that the Self-Control\/Instinct dice pool is reduced every night that the victim goes without feeding his addiction.","Level5":"<b>Dependence<\/b><br>Many former pawns of Clan Tremere claim to have felt a strange sensation similar to depression when not in the presence of their masters. This is usually attributed to the blood bond, but is sometimes the result of the vampire\u2019s mastery of Dependence. The final power of the Path of Corruption enables the vampire to tie her victim\u2019s soul to her own, engendering feelings of lethargy and helplessness when the victim is not in her presence or acting to further her desires.<br><b>System<\/b>: The character engages the target in conversation. The player rolls normally. The victim rolls Self-Control\/Instinct (difficulty equals the number of successes scored by the caster + 3). Failure means that the victim\u2019s psyche has been subtly bonded to that of the thaumaturge for one night per success rolled by the caster.<br>A bonded victim is no less likely to attack his controller, and feels no particular positive emotions toward her. However, he is psychologically addicted to her presence, and suffers a one-die penalty to all rolls when he is not around her or performing tasks for her.<br>Additionally, he is much less resistant to her commands, and his dice pools are halved when he attempts to resist her Dominate, Presence (or other mental or emotional control powers), or mundane Social rolls.

It is rumored that some Camarilla Tremere have learned this path, but very few of them have the right temperament to wield this path effectively.","Level1":"<b>War Cry<\/b><br>A vampire on the attack can focus his will, making him less susceptible to battle fear or the powers of the undead. The vampire shouts a primal scream to start the effect, though some thaumaturges have been known to paint their faces or cut themselves open instead.<br><b>System<\/b>: For the duration of one scene, the vampire adds one to his Courage Trait.

Only Melee or Brawl attacks may be made in this manner. These attacks are considered to be one-success attacks; they offer no additional damage dice. Also, they may be dodged, blocked, or parried normally, and the defender needs only one success (as the attacks\u2019 number of success is assumed to be one).<br>Strike True has no effect if attempted on multiple attacks (dice pool splits) in a single turn from one character.","Level3":"<b>Wind Dance<\/b><br>The thaumaturge invokes the power of the winds, moving in a blur.

The effects last for one scene, and a character may gain its benefits only once per scene.

More conservative Tremere, however, state that mixing Tremere magic with mortal science borders on treason or even blasphemy, and some European Regents have gone so far as to declare knowledge of Technomancy grounds for expulsion from their chantries.

The proliferation of usage of this path outside the Clan tends to confirm this theory; Weather Control is quite common outside the Tremere, and even outside the Camarilla. Lower levels of this path allow subtle manipulations, while higher stages of mastery allow a vampire to call up raging storms.

The difficulty of the Willpower roll necessary to invoke this power may change depending on the current local weather conditions and the weather the character is attempting to create. The Storyteller should impose a bonus (-1 or -2 difficulty) for relatively minor shifts, such as clearing away a light drizzle or calling lightning when a severe thunderstorm is already raging. Conversely, a penalty (+1 or +2 difficulty) should be applied when the desired change is at odds with the current conditions, such as summoning the same light drizzle in the middle of the Sahara Desert or calling down lightning from a cloudless sky.<br>If the character tries to strike a specific target with lightning, the player must roll ^Perception + Occult^ (difficulty 6 if the target is standing in open terrain, 8 if he is under shelter, or 10 if he is inside but near a window) in addition to the base roll to use Thaumaturgy. Otherwise the bolt goes astray, with the relative degree of failure of the roll determining where exactly the lightning strikes.<br>Effects of the power default to the maximum area available unless the caster states that he\u2019s attempting to affect a smaller area.

Awakening of the Steel is one legacy of this preparedness, a path that some say began with the alchemists who studied in the forges of Toledo and Damascus. This set of techniques focuses on the symbolism of the sword as the ultimate extension of a trained warrior\u2019s body, drawing on the myths that various warrior traditions attached to their swords and daggers: European Crusaders and their blessed blades, the kris of Indonesian Pentjak-Silat practitioners, and Indian Ghurkas and their kukri knives, among others. The practitioner of Awakening of the Steel focuses on this symbolism as he uses the power of his blood to enhance his weapon and his skill.<br>A student of Awakening of the Steel finds that a keen understanding of both the form and the function of a blade is necessary for full mastery of this path. A character must have a level of either Melee or Crafts Ability equal to his level in Awakening of the Steel.<br>Those who practice this path also find that its lessons are tightly focused, perhaps to the point of overspecialization.

Practitioners of Auspex are familiar with the manner in which inanimate objects can bear impressions of their own history. Confer with the Blade allows a weapon\u2019s wielder to delve into the events that have occurred around his weapon. Some practitioners of this power claim this makes the weapon feel more \u201ccomfortable\u201d in their hands, while others speak of the sense of history that an ancient blade bears. The actual impressions only take an instant to gain, though many prefer to spend much longer in contemplation if time permits.<br><b>System<\/b>: The number of successes determines the amount of information the sorcerer gains regarding the blade\u2019s history and its present state, as well as all information yielded by a lesser number of successes.

A blade that is under the effect of this art never leaves its master\u2019s hand unless he so wills it.<br><b>System<\/b>: For the rest of the scene, the character has a number of automatic successes to resist all attempts to disarm him, equal to the number of successes rolled. He cannot accidentally drop the blade (which means his botches are likely to result in self-mutilation instead of an empty hand). If the character is somehow disarmed in spite of Grasp of the Mountain, he may call the blade back to his hand by successfully invoking this power again, assuming he has a clear line of sight to the weapon.","Level3":"<b>Pierce Steel\u2019s Skin<\/b><br>At this level of understanding, the sorcerer can command his blade with such precision that he can strike at an opponent\u2019s physical protection rather than his body. The sword transfers its full fury to the intended target, shredding even the toughest chain or plate. This strips away the victim\u2019s defenses, leaving him vulnerable to the next attack. While this power is of limited utility in modern nights, as traditional armor has fallen by the wayside, it remains in the path\u2019s progression of lessons due to its utility in destroying other obstacles.<br><b>System<\/b>: While Pierce Steel\u2019s Skin is in effect, an attack against an unarmored target inflicts half damage (rounded down). However, for a number of turns equal to the number of successes rolled, each successful attack the character makes against an armored foe inflicts damage on the target\u2019s body armor rather than injuring him directly. Only metal armor can be damaged by this power. When the character makes a successful attack against an armored target, the player does not roll damage. Instead, he rolls a number of dice equal to the sword\u2019s damage bonus (the number of dice that it adds to his Strength) against a difficulty of 7. Each success reduces the armor\u2019s soak bonus by one die. Armor that is reduced to zero soak dice in this manner is completely destroyed and unsalvageable. Additional successes beyond those needed to destroy a piece of armor have no effect.<br>At the Storyteller\u2019s discretion, Pierce Steel\u2019s Skin may destroy other inanimate objects (walls, doors, cars, dramatically appropriate obstacles) without significant damage to the sword.

However, observers who are more pragmatic than romantic note that an enemy with a ranged weapon (be it bow, sling, or gun) has the advantage of striking from much farther away than arm\u2019s length. While Awakening of the Steel cannot completely counteract this advantage, this power allows the skilled sorcerer some measure of defense as the sword interposes itself between its master and attacks from afar.<br><b>System<\/b>: For a number of turns equal to the number of successes rolled, the character may attempt to parry projectiles. This requires one action for each projectile that the player wishes to block, and the character must be able to see the shot coming (Heightened Senses allows visual tracking of bullets). Each parrying attempt requires a ^Dexterity + Melee^ roll, with a difficulty determined by the speed of the projectile. Thrown objects have a difficulty of 6, arrows and crossbow bolts a difficulty of 7, and bullets a difficulty of 9.

Strike at the True Flesh invokes the very essence of the sorcerer\u2019s weapon, reducing it to the embodiment of its very definition (or, as the more classically minded would put it, invoking the Platonic form) while simplifying its target to a similarly basic level. The results of such an invocation are usually devastating on both a philosophical and practical level as weapon and victim momentarily lose all supernatural attributes.<br><b>System<\/b>: The effects of Strike at the True Flesh last for a number of turns equal to the number of successes rolled, and they end with the first successful attack that the character makes within this time period. The sword inflicts only the base amount of lethal damage that a weapon of its size and type would normally cause, disregarding all enhancements that it may have received (though augmentations to the wielder\u2019s strength or speed, such as Potence and Celerity, still have their normal effects, as do extra successes on the attack roll). However, all the target\u2019s supernatural defenses (including Fortitude) are likewise negated - he soaks the attack only with his base Stamina. If the negation of his powers and defenses renders the target unable to soak lethal damage, he cannot soak the attack at all.

Attribute: Manipulation","Level1":"<b>Fiery Courage<\/b><br>No vampire can master an element he fears, so this power dims that fear to a mere ember of its former intensity.<br><b>System<\/b>: Once learned, this power is permanent and requires no activation roll or blood. The koldun subtracts his rating in the Way of Fire from the difficulty of Courage rolls to resist R\u00f6tschreck from exposure or proximity to flame. This power does not aid in resisting the panic that accompanies sunlight or any other causes apart from actual fire. If this reduces the difficulty of a Courage roll below two, the koldun simply does not succumb to the Red Fear. Koldun never risk R\u00f6tschrek from fire and magma they conjure.","Level2":"<b>Combust<\/b><br>The Cainite\u2019s eyes flash vivid orange with sorcerous power as superheated air coils around the target. In moments, the target bursts into spontaneous flame.<br><b>System<\/b>: For every success on the activation roll, the target suffers one level of aggravated damage. This attack may be dodged, but not blocked, and can affect living (or unliving) beings at +2 difficulty. It is only possible to make one fiery attack per turn.","Level3":"<b>Wall of Magma<\/b><br>The koldun raises his hand and the earth splits, spraying a wall of glowing magma 10 feet\/3 meters high. Normally, this wall forms a 10-foot\/3-meter radius circle around the vampire, although the sorcerer can raise other shapes with practice and skill.<br><b>System<\/b>: The wall of magma summoned with this power has a lifespan of two turns per success rolled. If the koldun wishes to release the magma along a shape other than a protective circle, increase the base difficulty by one. Characters cannot approach a wall of molten rock without a Courage roll (difficulty 8), and even then, the close blistering heat inflicts a level of aggravated damage. Actual contact with the lava increases the damage to three levels and raises the soak difficulty to 9, assuming any sort of soak is possible. The koldun takes no damage from his proximity to the summoned magma (although contact with it still damages him as normal).","Level4":"<b>Heat Wave<\/b><br>The koldun acts as a conduit for steam geysers and channels a blast of desiccating air at a victim within line of sight. This fiery wind appears as a rippling heat wave enveloping the victim. Individuals slain with this gruesome power appear as withered, mummified husks.<br><b>System<\/b>: On a successful activation roll, the victim suffers five levels of lethal damage that may be soaked by beings capable of such. Vampire targets also lose five blood points, regardless of the damage inflicted.","Level5":"<b>Volcanic Blast<\/b><br>At the final mastery of Way of Fire, a koldun commands lava to explode from the ground in a huge geyser. The molten rock spews across a wide swath before crashing to earth and flowing in all directions. Anything in the path of the molten rock burns, melts, or vaporizes within moments. The caster may direct the lava to erupt anywhere in his line of sight.<br><b>System<\/b>: This power costs one Willpower point in addition to a blood point. For every success on the activation roll, the initial lava burst lasts one turn. The rivers of burning liquid rock then flow sluggishly for twice this duration before suddenly cooling and hardening.<br>Even if an object survives the heat, it now lies trapped beneath the rock. Anything that makes contact with lava (including the koldun) suffers a minimum of three levels of aggravated damage. For objects that don\u2019t have health levels, the Storyteller must decide how many turns they last before melting or erupting into their own inferno. A botch on this power opens the lava geyser under an unintended target, possibly the koldun himself."}]
