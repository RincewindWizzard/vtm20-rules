The vampire creates an empathic connection with a beast, thereby allowing him to communicate or issue simple commands. The Kindred locks eyes with the animal, transmitting his desires through sheer force of will. Although it isn\u2019t necessary to actually \u201cspeak\u201d in chirps, hisses, or barks, some vampires find that doing so helps strengthen the connection with the animal. Eye contact must be maintained the entire time; if it\u2019s broken, the Kindred must re-establish contact to continue communication. The simpler the creature, the more difficult it becomes to connect with the animal\u2019s Beast. Mammals, predatory birds, and larger reptiles are relatively easy to communicate with. Insects, invertebrates, and most fish are just too simple to connect with.<br>Feral Whispers provides no guarantees that an animal will want to deal with the vampire, nor does it ensure that the animal will pursue any requests the vampire makes of it. Still, it does at least make the creature better disposed toward the Kindred. The manner in which the vampire presents his desires to the animal often depends on the type of creature. A Kindred can often bully smaller beasts into heeding commands, but he\u2019s better off couching orders for large predators as requests.<br>If the vampire successfully uses the power, the animal performs the command to the best of its ability and intellect. Only the very brightest creatures understand truly complex directives (orders dealing with conditional situations or requiring abstract logic). Commands that the animal does understand remain deeply implanted, however, and guide its behavior for sometime.<br><b>System<\/b>: No roll is necessary to talk with an animal, but the character must establish eye contact (see p.152) first. Issuing commands requires a ^Manipulation + Animal Ken^ roll. The difficulty depends on the creature: Predatory mammals (wolves, cats, vampire bats) are difficulty 6, other mammals and predatory birds (rats, owls) are difficulty 7, and other birds and reptiles (pigeons, snakes) are difficulty 8. This difficulty is reduced by one if the character speaks to the animal in its \u201cnative tongue\u201d, and can be adjusted further by circumstances and roleplaying skill (we highly recommend that all communication between characters and animals be roleplayed).<br>The number of successes the player achieves dictates how strongly the character\u2019s command affects the animal. One success is sufficient to have a cat follow an individual and lead the character to the same location, three successes are enough to have a raven spy on a target for weeks, and five successes ensure that a grizzly ferociously guards the entrance to the character\u2019s wilderness haven for some months. The character\u2019s Nature plays a large part in how he approaches these conversations. The character might try intimidating, teasing, cajoling or rationalizing. The player should understand that he does not simply play his character in these situations, but the Beast Within as well. Using this power cannot force an animal to do something against its nature, or to force a creature to risk its life. While the aforementioned grizzly would stand guard to the vampire\u2019s haven and even fight for it, it would not do so against obviously superior numbers or something overwhelmingly supernatural. A predatory bird might be convinced to harry a target, but would definitely not hold ground. A docile dog or skittish cat would have no problem with reporting something it had seen, but it wouldn\u2019t enter combat unless given no other option - though it would likely agree to stand and fight and then flee at the first opportunity, if a harsh Kindred demanded it."}, {"ID":"2","DiscID":"1","Discipline":"Animalism","Level":"2","IsMultiBuy":"0","HasNotes":"0","Name":"Beckoning","Descr":"The vampire\u2019s connection to the Beast grows strong enough that he may call out in the voice of a specific type of animal - howling like a wolf, shrilling like a raven, etc. This call mystically summons creatures of the chosen type.

All such animals within earshot are summoned, and some percentage of them will heed the Beckoning if it is successful.

The vampire may also venture out during the day, albeit in the animal\u2019s body.

The Kindred \u201chears\u201d in her own mind the thoughts plucked from a subject as if they were spoken to her. This is one of the most potent vampiric abilities, since, given time, a Kindred can learn virtually anything from a subject without him ever knowing. The Tremere and Tzimisce in particular find this power especially useful in gleaning secrets from others, or for directing their mortal followers with silent precision.<br><b>System<\/b>: The player rolls ^Intelligence + Subterfuge^ (difficulty of the subject\u2019s current Willpower points).

To read minds, one success must be rolled for each item of information plucked or each layer of thought pierced. Deep secrets or buried memories are harder to obtain than surface emotions or unspoken comments, requiring five or more successes to access. Reading thoughts with Telepathy does not commonly work upon the undead mind. A character may expend a Willpower point to make the effort, making the roll normally afterward. Likewise, it is equally difficult to read the thoughts of other supernatural creatures. However, the character may project her thoughts without expending a Willpower point. These thoughts, however, are still obviously intrusions into the target\u2019s mind, but the character may attempt to disguise her mental \u201cvoice\u201d with a roll of ^Manipulation + Subterfuge^ (difficulty equals the target\u2019s Perception + Awareness) so the target doesn\u2019t recognize her as the \u201cspeaker\u201d. Storytellers are encouraged to describe thoughts as flowing streams of impressions and images, rather than as a sequence of prose (powers such as Telepathic Communication are of more use for that). Instead of making flat statements like \u201cHe\u2019s planning on killing his former lover\u2019s new boyfriend\u201d, say \u201cYou see a fleeting series of visions: A couple kissing passionately in a doorway, then the man walking alone at night; you suddenly see your hands, knuckles white, wrapped around a steering wheel, with a figure crossing the street ahead; your heart, mortal now and hammering with panic as you hear the engine rev wildly; and above all, a blazing anger coupled with emotional agony and a panicked fear of loss\u201d. Such descriptions not only add to the story, but they also force the player to interpret for herself what her character gleans.

The vampire\u2019s astral form is immune to physical damage or fatigue, and can \u201cfly\u201d with blinding speed anywhere across the earth - or even underground - so long as she remains below the moon\u2019s orbit.<br>The Kindred\u2019s material form lies in a torpid state while her astral self is active, and the vampire isn\u2019t aware of anything that befalls her body until she returns to it. An ephemeral silver cord connects the Kindred\u2019s psyche to her body. If this cord is severed, her consciousness becomes stranded in the astral plane (the realm of ghosts, spirits and shades). Attempting to return to the vampire\u2019s physical shell is a long and terrifying ordeal, especially since there is no guarantee that she will accomplish the journey successfully. This significant danger keeps many Kindred from leaving their bodies for long, but those who dare can learn much.<br><b>System<\/b>: Journeying in astral form requires the player to expend a point of Willpower and make a ^Perception + Awareness^ roll. Difficulty varies depending on the distance and complexity of the intended trip; 5 is within sight, 7 is nearby or to a familiar location, and 9 reflects a trip far from familiar territory (a first journey from North America to the Far East; trying to shortcut through the earth). The greater the number of successes rolled, the more focused the character\u2019s astral presence is and the easier it is for her to reach her desired destination.<br>Failure means the character is unable to separate her consciousness from her body, while a botch can have nasty consequences - flinging her astral form to a random destination on Earth or in the spirit realm, arriving in a place where the sun is active (necessitating a frenzy roll, although the sunlight doesn\u2019t do any damage), or hurtling toward the desired destination so forcefully that the silver cord snaps.<br>The player may spend a point of Willpower to activate this power, and an additional point of Willpower to gain the success necessary to perform the jaunt. This is an exception to the normal rule where a player may not spend more than a single point of Willpower per turn.<br>Each scene in Psychic Projection requires another point of Willpower and a new roll. Failure indicates that the vampire has lost her way and must retrace the path of her silver cord. A botch at this stage means the cord snaps, stranding the character\u2019s psychic form in the mysterious astral plane. An astral form may travel at great speeds (the Storyteller can use roughly 1000 miles per hour or 1500 kilometers per hour as a general guide) and carries no clothing or material objects of any kind. Some artifacts are said to exist in the spirit world, and the character can try to use one of these tools if she finds one. The character cannot bring such relics to the physical world when she returns to her body, however. Interaction with the physical world is impossible while using Psychic Projection. At best, the character may spend a Willpower point to manifest as a ghost-like shape. This apparition lasts one turn before fading away; while she can\u2019t affect anything physically during this time, the character can speak. Despite lacking physical substance, an astral character can use Auspex normally. At the Storyteller\u2019s discretion, such a character may employ some or all Animalism, Dementation, Dominate, Necromancy, Obtenebration, Presence, Thaumaturgy, and similar non-corporeal powers she has, though this typically requires a minimum of three successes on the initial Psychic Projection roll. If two astral shapes encounter one another, they interact as if they were solid. They may talk, touch,and even fight as if both were in the material world. Since they have no physical bodies, astral characters seeking to interact \u201cphysically\u201d substitute Mental and Social Traits for Physical ones (Wits replaces Dexterity, Manipulation supplants Strength, and Intelligence replaces Stamina). Due to the lack of a material form, the only real way to damage another psychic entity is to cut its silver cord. When fighting this way, consider Willpower points to be health levels; when a combatant loses all of her Willpower, the cord is severed. Although an astrally projected character remains in the reflection of the mortal world, she may venture further into the spirit realms, especially if she becomes lost. Other beings with particular sensitivity to psychic activity, such as ghosts, werewolves, and even some magi, travel the astral plane as well, and can interact with a vampire\u2019s psychic presence normally (although the astrally projected character is not considered a \u201cghost\u201d for powers such as Necromancy). The observing character notices the astrally projecting vampire with a Perception + Awareness roll (difficulty 8), requiring more successes than the Psychic Projection activation roll. Even those who do notice you won\u2019t be able to identify you; you are merely an immaterial shade hovering in the general area. Storytellers are encouraged to make trips into the spirit world as bizarre, mysterious and dream-like as possible.

He may alter the subject\u2019s mind only slightly (quite effective for eliminating memories of the victim meeting or even being fed upon by the vampire) or utterly undo the victim\u2019s memories of her past. The degree of detail used has a direct bearing on how strongly the new memories take hold, since the victim\u2019s subconscious mind resists the alteration. A simplistic or incomplete false memory (\u201cYou went to the movies last night\u201d) crumbles much more quickly than does one with more attention to detail (\u201cYou thought about texting your girlfriend while you were in line at the new movie theater, but you knew you\u2019d have to turn your phone off once you got inside. You liked the movie well enough, but the plot seemed weak. You were tired after it ended, so you went home, watched a little late-night television, and went to bed\u201d).<br>Even in its simplest applications, The Forgetful Mind requires tremendous skill and finesse. It\u2019s a relatively simple matter to rife through a victim\u2019s psyche and rip out the memories of the previous night without knowing what the subject did that evening. Doing so leaves a gap in the victim\u2019s mind, however - a hole that can give rise to further problems down the road. The Kindred may describe new memories, but these recollections seldom have the same degree of realism that the subject\u2019s original thoughts held. As such, this power isn\u2019t always completely effective. The victim may remember being bitten, but believe it to be an animal attack. Greater memories may return in pieces as dreams, or through sensory triggers like a familiar odor or spoken phrase. Even so, months or years may pass before the subject regains enough of her lost memories to make sense of the fragments. A vampire can also sense when a subject\u2019s memories were altered through use of this power, and even restore them, as a hypnotist draws forth suppressed thoughts.<br><b>System<\/b>: The player states what sorts of alteration he wants to perform, then rolls ^Wits + Subterfuge^ (difficulty equal to the target\u2019s current Willpower points). Any success pacifies the victim for the amount of time it takes the vampire to perform the verbal alteration, provided the vampire does not act aggressively toward her. The table below indicates the degree of modification possible to the subject\u2019s memory. If the successes rolled don\u2019t allow for the extent of change the character desired, the Storyteller reduces the resulting impact on the victim\u2019s mind.<br><table><tr><th>Successes<\/th><th>Result<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>1 success<\/td><td>May remove a single memory;lasts one day.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2 successes<\/td><td>May remove, but not alter, memory permanently.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3 successes<\/td><td>May make slight changes to memory.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4 successes<\/td><td>May alter or remove entire scenefrom subject\u2019s memory.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5 successes<\/td><td>May reconstruct entire periods of subject\u2019s life.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>To restore removed memories or sense false ones in a subject, the character\u2019s Dominate rating must be equal to or higher than that of the vampire who made the alteration.

However, the Kindred cannot use The Forgetful Mind to restore his own memories if they were stolen in such a way."}, {"ID":"61","DiscID":"6","Discipline":"Dominate","Level":"4","IsMultiBuy":"0","HasNotes":"0","Name":"Conditioning","Descr":"Through sustained manipulation, the vampire can make a subject more pliant to the Kindred\u2019s will. Over time, the victim becomes increasingly susceptible to the vampire\u2019s infuence while simultaneously growing more resistant to the corrupting efforts of other Kindred. Gaining complete control over a subject\u2019s mind is no small task, taking weeks or even months to accomplish. Kindred often fill their retainers\u2019 heads with subtle whispers and veiled urges, thereby ensuring these mortals\u2019 loyalty. Yet vampires must pay a high price for the minds they ensnare. Servants Dominated in this way lose much of their passion and individuality. They follow the vampire\u2019s orders quite literally, seldom taking initiative or showing any imagination. In the end, such retainers become like automatons or the walking dead.<br><b>System<\/b>: The player rolls ^Charisma + Leadership^ (difficulty equal to the target\u2019s current Willpower points) once per scene. Conditioning is an extended action, for which the Storyteller secretly determines the number of successes required. It typically requires between five and 10 times the subject\u2019s Self-Control\/Instinct rating. Targets with more empathic Natures may require a lower number of successes, while those with willful Natures require a higher total. Only through roleplaying may a character discern whether his subject is conditioned successfully.<br>A target may become more tractable even before becoming fully conditioned. Once the vampire accumulates half the required number of successes, the Storyteller may apply a lower difficulty to the vampire\u2019s subsequent uses of Dominate. After being conditioned, the target falls so far under the vampire\u2019s infuence that the Kindred need not make eye contact or even be present to retain absolute control. The subject does exactly as she is told (including taking actions that would injure herself), as long as her master can communicate with her verbally. No command roll is necessary unless the subject is totally isolated from the vampire\u2019s presence (in a different room, over the phone). Even if a command roll fails, the target will still likely carry out part of the orders given, simply because her master wishes it.<br>After the subject is fully conditioned, other Kindred find her more difficult to Dominate. Such conditioning raises others\u2019 difficulties by two (to a maximum of 10). It is possible, though difficult, to shake Conditioning. The subject must be separated entirely from the vampire to whom she was in thrall. This period of separation varies depending on the individual, but the Storyteller may set it at six months, less a number of weeks equal to the subject\u2019s permanent Willpower rating (so a person with 5 Willpower must stay away from the vampire for just under five months). The subject regains her personality slowly during this time, though she may still lapse into brief spells of listlessness, despair, or even anger. If the vampire encounters the target before that time passes, a single successful ^Charisma + Leadership^ roll (difficulty of the target\u2019s current Willpower points) on the part of the vampire completely reasserts the dominance. If the subject makes it through the time period without intervention by her master, the target regains her former individuality. Even so, the vampire may reestablish conditioning more easily than the first time, since the subject is now predisposed to falling under the Kindred\u2019s mental control. New attempts require half the total number of successes than the last bout of conditioning did (which means the subject reaches the threshold for reduced difficulties sooner, as well)."}, {"ID":"62","DiscID":"6","Discipline":"Dominate","Level":"5","IsMultiBuy":"0","HasNotes":"0","Name":"Possession","Descr":"At this level of Dominate, the force of the Kindred\u2019s psyche is such that it can utterly supplant the mind of a mortal subject. Speaking isn\u2019t required, but the vampire must capture the victim\u2019s gaze. During the psychic struggle, the contestants\u2019 eyes are locked on one another. Once the Kindred overwhelms the subject\u2019s mind, the vampire moves his consciousness into the victim\u2019s body and controls it as easily as he uses his own. The mortal falls into a mental fugue while under possession. She is aware of events only in a distorted, dreamlike fashion. In turn, the vampire\u2019s mind focuses entirely on controlling his mortal subject. His own body lies in a torpid state, defenseless against any actions made toward it. Vampires cannot possess one another in this fashion, as even the weakest Kindred\u2019s mind is strong enough to resist such straightforward mental dominance. Only through a blood bond can one vampire control another to this degree. Supernatural creatures also cannot be possessed in this way, although ghouls that have drunk from the vampire using Possession can.<br><b>System<\/b>: The vampire must completely strip away the target\u2019s Willpower prior to possessing her. The player spends a Willpower point, then rolls ^Charisma + Intimidation^, while the subject rolls his Willpower in a resisted action (difficulty 7 for each). For each success the vampire obtains over the victim\u2019s total, the target loses a point of temporary Willpower. Only if the attacker botches can the subject escape her fate, since this makes the target immune to any further Dominate attempts by that vampire for the rest of the story. Once the target loses all her temporary Willpower, her mind is open. The vampire rolls ^Manipulation + Intimidation^ (difficulty 7) to determine how fully he assumes control of the mortal shell. Similar to the Animalism power Subsume the Spirit, multiple successes allow the character to utilize some mental Disciplines, noted on the chart below.

The vampire may also venture out during the day in the mortal form. However, the vampire\u2019s own body must be awake to do so, requiring a successful roll to remain awake (see p.262). If the vampire leaves the mortal shell (by choice, if his body falls asleep, through supernatural expulsion, after sustaining significant injury, etc.), his consciousness returns to his physical form in an instant.<br>Once freed from possession, the mortal regains mental control of herself. This can happen in an instant, or the victim may lie comatose for days while her psyche copes with the violation.<br>The vampire experiences everything the mortal body feels during possession, from pleasure to pain. In fact, any damage the victim\u2019s body sustains is also applied to the character\u2019s body (though the Kindred may soak as normal). If the mortal dies before the vampire\u2019s soul can flee from the body, the character\u2019s body falls into torpor. Presumably this is in sympathetic response to the massive trauma of death, though some Kindred believe that the vampire\u2019s soul is cast adrift during this time and must find its way back to the body.<br>The Kindred can remain in the mortal\u2019s body even if his own torpid form is destroyed, though such a pathetic creature is not likely to exist for long. At each sunrise, the vampire must roll Courage (difficulty 8) or be expelled from the body. If forced from the mortal body, the vampire tumbles into the astral plane, his soul permanently lost in the spirit world. A vampire trapped in a mortal body may not be \u201cre-Embraced\u201d.

The Warlocks claim that the Salubri use this power to remove the souls of their victims, alter them in horrible ways, or simply consume them and then make mindless slaves from the blasted husks. The truth is that the Cyclops use this power to rebuild a target\u2019s tattered soul, at the expense of their own mental fortitude. The Salubri draws the subject\u2019s soul out of his body, and into the vampire\u2019s third eye. There, the vampire repairs the soul. During this time, the target\u2019s body is vacant, but alive.

By a similar process, the character can cleanse a person, place, or object of demonic or evil infuence. This isn\u2019t a simple banishment, however.

The Salubri must make eye contact with the subject and the subject must be willing to be subjected to this power. A soul drawn out in this manner becomes part of the Salubri\u2019s soul while the healing process takes place. She may return it to its proper body at any time. While the soul is within the Salubri, she may spend a permanent Willpower point to restore a point to the subject\u2019s Humanity or Path rating. The Salubri may restore a maximum number of points equal to her Empathy rating, and may not raise the subject\u2019s Humanity or Path higher than the sum of his relevant Virtues (for example, a character subscribing to Humanity with Conscience 3 and Self-Control 3 could not have his Humanity raised above 6 in this manner). While a soul is being held by the Salubri, its body is an empty husk, comatose or in torpor, with no motivating force within it. A soul whose body is killed immediately vanishes, its disposition unknown to any (although the Salubri strongly suspect that souls that vanish in this manner are completely and irreversibly destroyed). Killing the body of a drawn-out soul may warrant a Conscience or Conviction roll if the killer knows of the soul\u2019s absence, at the Storyteller\u2019s discretion. If used to draw out a demon, the player spends a Willpower point if the subject is willing and the corrupting agent does not resist (a rare occurrence). If the subject is possessed by a conscious entity, the demon (or other foreign consciousness) fights the Salubri for dominance. This takes place via an extended, contested roll of the Salubri\u2019s ^Humanity or Path^ versus the opponent\u2019s Willpower (each party\u2019s difficulty is equal to the other\u2019s current Willpower).

The mortal sleeps for five to 10 hours - whatever his normal sleep cycle is - and regains one temporary Willpower point upon awakening. He sleeps peacefully and does not suffer nightmares or the effects of any derangements while asleep. He may be awakened normally (or violently). Kindred, including the Salubri herself, are unaffected by this power - their corpse-like bodies are too tied to death."}, {"ID":"293","DiscID":"31","Discipline":"Valeren","Level":"3","IsMultiBuy":"0","HasNotes":"0","Name":"Burning Touch","Descr":"The character\u2019s hands bring searing pain, as though the target is being burnt with red-hot metal. Although the power does not inflict actual damage, prolonged or repeated exposure can be enough to traumatize a victim. This power works extremely well as a torture method.<br><b>System<\/b>: The vampire must touch his subject for this power to take effect, and the effects diminish rapidly after he removes his hand. The player spends at least one blood point to activate this power, and each blood point spent reduces the victim\u2019s dice pools by two while the Fury is in contact with the victim. This power is often used for interrogation or torture, wearing down the subject\u2019s resistance and rendering him much more tractable."}, {"ID":"294","DiscID":"31","Discipline":"Valeren","Level":"4","IsMultiBuy":"0","HasNotes":"0","Name":"Armor of Caine\u2019s Fury","Descr":"The Salubri <i>antitribu<\/i> is surrounded by a shining, crimson halo. This phantom armor protects the vampire against most physical injury, as well as against R\u00f6tschreck.<br><b>System<\/b>: The player spends one blood point and rolls ^Stamina + Melee^ (difficulty 7). For each success, the character gains one point of armor protection against bashing and lethal damage, to a maximum of five points of protection. Additionally, for every two successes rolled, she gains an additional die to resist R\u00f6tschreck from the effects of battle (but not fire or sunlight).

Some Furies invoke the names of ancient Salubri warriors, while others simply close their normal eyes and let Samiel guide their hands.<br><b>System<\/b>: This power costs three blood points. Any single attack made by the vampire automatically hits the target as mystic forces guide the blow. Attacks made in this manner may not be dodged, though they may be blocked, parried, and soaked as normal. The blow strikes as if the Salubri <i>antitribu<\/i> had succeeded with all of his Dexterity + Melee or Brawling dice pool (which makes for significant damage). This power may be used only once per turn, and only then the Salubri <i>antitribu<\/i>\u2019s sole action is the attack. Additionally, this power does not work for ranged weapons; only bare hands or melee weapons."}, {"ID":"296","DiscID":"31","Discipline":"Valeren","Level":"6","IsMultiBuy":"0","HasNotes":"0","Name":"Blissful Agony","Descr":"The vampire may cause pain with a mere touch, as per Burning Touch, but this pain lingers and swells even after the Fury has removed her hand. It is believed that this power was originally used to acclimate warrior Salubri to the pain they would experience in battle, but among the Sabbat Salubri, Blissful Agony has been turned to more brutal uses. If applied with enough intensity, Blissful Agony can drive vampires to the point of frenzy, incapacitate Lupines, and even kill mortals outright.<br><b>System<\/b>: The player makes a ^Willpower^ roll (difficulty 8) and spends a blood point. The power lasts for one scene, though this duration may be prolonged if the Salubri <i>antitribu<\/i> wishes by making a subsequent ^Willpower^ roll (though no additional blood points need be spent). The character must touch her subject for the power to take effect initially. At the vampire\u2019s option, she may cause actual physical damage to the victim at the rate of one health level per blood point spent, though touch must be maintained for this to happen. Damage to vampires and other supernatural creatures in this fashion vanishes at the next sunset, but mortals must heal the damage normally. This damage is considered lethal damage, and mortals may not soak it (though vampires and other supernatural entities may). To induce frenzy in a victim, the Fury must cause damage in excess of the subject\u2019s Willpower. At that point, the subject must make a Willpower roll (difficulty 6) or succumb to frenzy."}, {"ID":"297","DiscID":"32","Discipline":"Visceratika","Level":"1","IsMultiBuy":"0","HasNotes":"0","Name":"Skin of the Chameleon","Descr":"This basic power has saved countless Gargoyles breaching the Masquerade - and has allowed just as many to ambush unsuspecting intruders. When Skin of the Chameleon is in effect, the Gargoyle\u2019s skin takes on the color and texture of the surrounding environment. This coloration changes reflexively as long as the Gargoyle maintains a walking pace or slower. More rapid movement causes the Gargoyle\u2019s appearance to blur, negating the camouflaging effect. If this power is used while the Gargoyle is in flight, his skin becomes a reasonable facsimile of the night sky (though it will not shift to mimic nearby skyscrapers or star patterns, and a black silhouette against a brightly lit skyline is likely to be noticed).<br><b>System<\/b>: The player spends one blood point. For the rest of the scene, the Gargoyle\u2019s Stealth dice pool is increased by five. This power is subject to the limitations described above. Any ground movement faster than a walk negates this power\u2019s effect, as does flight (at the Storyteller\u2019s discretion)."}, {"ID":"298","DiscID":"32","Discipline":"Visceratika","Level":"2","IsMultiBuy":"0","HasNotes":"0","Name":"Scry the Hearthstone","Descr":"The Gargoyles\u2019 first function for the Tremere was that of guardian and watchdog. This power allows them to know instinctively where anyone is inside a given structure. It even allows the Gargoyle to detect characters concealed by magical means, if the Slave is perceptive enough.<br><b>System<\/b>: The player spends a Willpower point to activate this power, which remains in effect as long as the Gargoyle is within or in contact with the target structure, or until the next sunset. Scry the Hearthstone may be used on anything up to the size of a cave complex, a large theatre, a parking garage, or a mansion. The character gains an innate sense of the location and approximate size and physical condition of all living (or unliving) beings within the structure. To pinpoint a specific individual\u2019s location with this power, the player must succeed in a ^Perception + Awareness^ roll (difficulty 6). If the subject is attempting to hide, he may oppose this roll with a roll of Wits + Stealth (difficulty 6). Scry the Hearthstone may be used to detect the presence of characters who are under Obfuscate or similar powers. In this case, the Gargoyle only knows that there is someone present - she cannot actually see the individual in question. To determine the Gargoyle\u2019s ability to detect Obfuscated characters, compare the relative levels of the Gargoyle\u2019s Visceratika minus one and the intruder\u2019s Obfuscate as per the \u201cSeeing the Unseen\u201d sidebar on p.142."}, {"ID":"299","DiscID":"32","Discipline":"Visceratika","Level":"3","IsMultiBuy":"0","HasNotes":"0","Name":"Bond with the Mountain","Descr":"The Gargoyle sinks into a stone surface, disappearing into the rock until he wishes to reappear. This power allowed Gargoyles to invade their masters\u2019 enemies\u2019 strongholds, fight until sunrise, then meld with the rocks or stone walls and reappear the next evening. In modern nights, it can take the place of a haven for itinerant Runaways. Unlike the Earth Meld power (p.199) which it resembles, Bond with the Mountain does not conceal the Gargoyle completely. A faint outline of his body can be seen in the rock where he hides.<br><b>System<\/b>: The player spends two blood points, and the merge takes four turns to complete. This power functions in a fashion similar to the Protean 3 power of Earth Meld, and may only be performed upon bare rock or a similar substance. However, the Gargoyle does not sink fully into the substance with which he merges, and his outline can be detected within the stone with a successful Perception + Alertness roll (difficulty 9). A Gargoyle attacked while Bonded with the Mountain has triple his normal soak dice pool against all forms of attack. However, if he sustains three or more lethal health levels of damage from a single attack, he is forced out of his bond and suffers disorientation similar to that experienced by an Earth Melded character whose slumber is interrupted."}, {"ID":"300","DiscID":"32","Discipline":"Visceratika","Level":"4","IsMultiBuy":"0","HasNotes":"0","Name":"Armor of Terra","Descr":"At this level of Visceratika, the Gargoyle\u2019s skin hardens and becomes truly rock-like to the touch. The Slave becomes harder to harm, even with fire, and grows inured to injury. A non-Gargoyle learning this level of Visceratika would find her skin becoming gray and rock-like, putting lie to the claim that the Discipline doesn\u2019t carry the risk of the Gargoyle\u2019s curse.<br><b>System<\/b>: This power is automatic and requires no roll; it is always in effect. A vampire with Armor of Terra has one extra soak die for all aggravated and lethal attacks and two for all bashing attacks, reduces all wound penalties by one, and halves the damage dice pool of any fire-based source of injury (this Discipline does not change the rules for R\u00f6tschreck, however).

Now, he can flow through stone like lava working its way down a mountainside, emerging from the hiding place at any point he wishes. Since this power works on cement or concrete as well as rock, the streets of a modern metropolis afford a Gargoyle some very interesting assassination tools.<br><b>System<\/b>: Once the character has used Bond with the Mountain, the player spends two more blood points to activate Flow Within the Mountain for the duration of the scene. The Gargoyle can move within stone and cement (otherwise using the same rules as the Protean power Earth Control, p.200). The character can also use this power to walk through a stone wall and emerge on the other side without first using Bond with the Mountain. In this case, the player spends one blood point and rolls Strength (difficulty 8; Potence adds dice or successes normally). The Gargoyle may flow through a maximum thickness in feet equal to the number of successes rolled, or 30 times the number of successes rolled in centimeters.
