[{"ID":"1","AType":"Talents","Name":"Alertness","Descr":"This is your basic knack for noticing things that go on around you, even when you\u2019re not actively looking for them. Alertness describes the attention you pay to the outside world, whether otherwise occupied or not. This Talent is typically paired with Perception, and is best used when sensing physical stimuli (as opposed to moods or clues).<br><b>Possessed by<\/b>: Hunters, Bodyguards, Security Personnel, Journalists, Burglars<br><b>Specialties<\/b>: Noises, Eavesdropping, Fine Details, Hidden Weapons, Crowds, Forests, Animals","Level1":"Novice: You\u2019re no mindless drone.","Level2":"Practiced: Habitual eavesdropper.","Level3":"Competent: You keep a sharp eye on your surroundings.","Level4":"Expert: Whether from paranoia or good sense, you are rarely caught off-guard.","Level5":"Master: Your senses are on par with those of a wild animal."}, {"ID":"2","AType":"Talents","Name":"Athletics","Descr":"This Talent represents your basic athletic ability, as well as any training you might have had in sports or other rigorous activities. Athletics concerns all forms of running, jumping, throwing, swimming, sports, and the like.

It differs from Alertness (which measures sensitivity to mundane events) and Occult (which covers actual knowledge about the supernatural). Usually, only supernatural creatures have access to this particular Talent, but some unique mortals have a sense that something is strange in the world (such as those with True Faith - see p. 372). Characters with Awareness sometimes get hunches, chills or sudden flashes of inspiration when they are near supernatural creatures, objects or events. This insight is purely subconscious, and knowing that something\u2019s wrong doesn\u2019t mean that the character knows what it is. To get more specific information, the Kindred will need to use Occult or a particular power - Awareness only makes the vampire more receptive to the presence of the unusual. A vampire can use Awareness deliberately if he suspects that something is supernatural, but more often the Storyteller can ask for an Awareness roll to determine whether a vampire notices a strange event that\u2019s not immediately visible.<br><b>Possessed by<\/b>: Psychics, New Agers, Mystics, Paranormal Researchers<br><b>Specialties<\/b>: Ghostly Activity, Mystical Objects, Someone\u2019s In My Head, Debunking","Level1":"Novice: Once in a while, you get the feeling that something isn\u2019t right.","Level2":"Practiced: You sometimes get strange vibes from a particular direction or vague area (like a building).","Level3":"Competent: You can walk into a room and know that something unusual is going on within.","Level4":"Expert: If you concentrate, you can sense whether a someone in a group of people or a collection of objects is supernatural.","Level5":"Master: You instinctually know if something or someone is mundane or supernatural."}, {"ID":"4","AType":"Talents","Name":"Brawl","Descr":"The Brawl Talent represents how well you fight in tooth-and-nail situations.

Additionally, this Talent represents your ability for poetry, creative writing or other literary art forms. For many elders, Expression is the subtle art of crafting a satirical epigram capable of socially crippling one\u2019s longtime rival.
