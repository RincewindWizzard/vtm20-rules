# vtm20-rules
Character creation rules for Vampire: The Masquerade - 20th Anniversay Edition in machine readable form.

While browsing on the internet I found many people, who over the years tried to code character cheets for Vampire the Masquerade.
Many projects are stuck in a pre alpha phase. One of the problems I suppose holding these projects back is the lack of the rules in machine readable form. 

That is which clans, disciplines, and paths of enlighment exist and their descriptions.
I am trying to provide as many data formats I can with converters, so you can edit the source files and convert it to your preferred data format (json, xml, sql).
If anybody likes this project, give me a star + pull request.
