An acquaintance from your breathing days was Embraced at the same time you were. Fortunately, your friendship has endured even in death and unlife, and you find a constant source of support and aid in your old friend. She expects the same of you, which isnâ€™t always convenient, but at least you each have someone to hang onto who remembers the good old nights - and days. The Storyteller should play the Old Pal as a very loyal Ally.
