You can see and interpret signs and omens. You are able to draw advice from these omens, for they provide hints of the future and warnings of the present. When the Storyteller feels that you are in position to see an omen, you will be required to make a ^Perception + Awareness^ roll, with the difficulty relative to how well the omen is concealed. If successful, you may then roll ^Intelligence + Occult^ to interpret what you have seen; the difficulty is again relative to the complexity of the omen.
