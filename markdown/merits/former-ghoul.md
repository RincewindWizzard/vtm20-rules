You were introduced to the Blood long before you were made Kindred. Your long experience as a ghoul gives you insight into and comfort with vampiric society. You are at -1 difficulty on all Social rolls when in the presence of other neonates (particularly those who havenâ€™t been educated by their sires), and have a -1 difficulty on all rolls relating to vampiric knowledge.
