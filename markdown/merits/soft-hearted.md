You cannot stand to watch others suffer. You avoid any situation that involves causing someone physical or emotional pain, unless you make a ^Willpower^ roll (difficulty 8). You must have a Humanity rating of 7 or above to take this Flaw - vampires on Paths of Enlightenment can only take this Flaw with Storyteller approval.
