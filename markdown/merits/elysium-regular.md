You spend an unusual amount of time in Elysium. You see and are seen to such an extent that all of the movers and shakers of Elysium at least know who you are. Extended time spent in Elysium also gives you extended opportunities to interact with the Harpies and other Kindred of that stature - and theyâ€™ll know your name when you approach them. This Merit is generally taken by vampires that respect and attend Elysium on a regular basis.
