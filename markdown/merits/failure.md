You once held a title in the city, but failed catastrophically in your duties. Now you are branded incompetent, excluded from circles of power and responsibility, and generally ostracized by those on their way up. Your exclusion may make you a target for recruitment by the Sectâ€™s enemies (or so the whispers run, making you even more distrusted). Conversely, the consequences of your error might come back to haunt you.
