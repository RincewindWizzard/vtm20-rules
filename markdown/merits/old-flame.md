Someone you once cared deeply for is now with the enemy. He still attempts to play on your sympathies “for old times’ sake” while working against you. Unless you succeed on a contested ^Manipulation + Expression^ roll against your former friend, you cannot act against him unless the situation becomes life-threatening.
