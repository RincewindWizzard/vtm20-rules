The blood point costs of nightly rising, creating and sustaining ghouls, and creating blood bonds remains the same as for other vampires. You cannot raise any Discipline above four dots. Taking this Flaw precludes you from taking the Generation Background, and you may not start with Status, either.

You can use the remaining four blood points to survive through the day and wake up each night, nothing more. You cannot raise any Discipline above three dots. The weakening of the Curse of Caine has compensations, though (which distinguish this Flaw from the Thin Blood Flaw itself). Sunlight does lethal damage to you, instead of aggravated damage as it does to other vampires. You can hold down mortal food and drink for an hour or so; other vampires vomit immediately if they try (unless they have the Eat Food Merit).

The disease can be anything from rabies to HIV, and Kindred who drink your blood have a 10% chance of becoming a carrier as well.

Characters can compensate for the loss of vision by becoming more attuned to other sensory input, but visual cues and images are lost to them. Difficulties of all Dexterity-based rolls are increased by two. Oddly, vampires with Aura Perception (Auspex 2) are still able to use this ability, though the information is interpreted via the other senses.

Against Level Six powers, the expenditure of a Willpower point through Iron Will only raises the difficulty of the Discipline roll by two.

Even after your Embrace you refused to believe you were a vampire. You remain convinced that there is some logical explanation for your condition, and spend as much time as you can searching for it. You also have problems feeding, and may insist on trying to eat regular food. None of these habits makes you particularly pleasant company for other Kindred. This Flaw must be roleplayed at all times, and is generally taken by Camarilla vampires."}, {"ID":"77","MType":"Mental","Name":"Weak-Willed","Cost":"-3","IsMultiBuy":"0","HasNotes":"0","Descr":"You are highly susceptible to Dominate and intimidation by others; Dominate attempts automatically affect you unless the Discipline wielder is of higher Generation, and your difficulties to resist Social abilities such as Intimidation or Leadership, as well as mind-altering spells or magic, are increased by two.

You suffer horrible guilt over each time you feed (roll Conscience, difficulty 7, or else frenzy every time you feed - characters with the Conviction Virtue cannot take this Flaw) and try to avoid doing so as much as possible.

The most insignificant thing can throw you into a different mood or state of mind, and as such your behavior is extremely unpredictable. Because of your precarious emotional state, your Willpower fluctuates. At the beginning of each story, make a ^Willpower^ roll (you may not spend Willpower for an automatic success). If you succeed, you may participate in the story as normal. If you fail, however, your Willpower score is considered to be 1 for the duration of that session, and you only have one Willpower point to spend.

While that sort of estimation may seem insulting, it\u2019s also what\u2019s kept you from being killed. No one considers you worth their time to deal with, and that low opinion keeps you safe.

Regardless, your reputation as a weasel precedes you, putting you at +1 difficulty on all Social rolls against those who don\u2019t agree with your politics."}, {"ID":"139","MType":"Social","Name":"Sleeping With the Enemy","Cost":"-3","IsMultiBuy":"0","HasNotes":"1","Descr":"You have some sort of intimate connection with a member of an opposing Sect or inimical Clan. You may have a lover, a childe, a friend, or a contact working the other side of the fence, but regardless of politics you retain a friendly (or more than friendly) relationship with your putative foe. Your close ties to someone on the other side would be regarded as treason by your superiors within the Sect, and if you are discovered, the penalty will surely be death."}, {"ID":"140","MType":"Social","Name":"Clan Enmity","Cost":"-4","IsMultiBuy":"0","HasNotes":"1","Descr":"One Clan in particular wants you dead. You have offended the entire Clan, from elders to neonates, and as a result every member of that bloodline wants your head on a plate. The effects of the Flaw may manifest as anything from very public snubs and insults to actual attempts on your unlife. You are also at +2 difficulty on all Social rolls relating to members of the Clan in question."}, {"ID":"141","MType":"Social","Name":"Loathsome Regnant","Cost":"-4","IsMultiBuy":"0","HasNotes":"0","Descr":"Not only are you blood bound, but you are also in thrall to a vampire who mistreats you hideously. Perhaps you are publicly abused or humiliated; perhaps your master forces you to commit unspeakable acts for him. In any case, existence under the bond is a never-ending nightmare, with your regnant serving to conduct the symphony of malice. Sabbat vampires cannot take this Flaw."}, {"ID":"142","MType":"Social","Name":"Overextended","Cost":"-4","IsMultiBuy":"0","HasNotes":"0","Descr":"You\u2019ve got your fingers in too many pies, and people are starting to notice. You have too many ghouls, too many retainers, or too much infuence, which means that a lot of people have a vested interest in trimming back your operations. These enemies take every opportunity to reduce your power and infuence, and if that means lying, cheating, or killing, so be it. Furthermore, your enemies block every attempt you make to move into new areas of control. You\u2019re boxed in, and the box is getting smaller."}, {"ID":"143","MType":"Social","Name":"Probationary Sect Member","Cost":"-4","IsMultiBuy":"0","HasNotes":"0","Descr":"You are a defector. You turned traitor to the Camarilla, Sabbat, or other Sect, and you still have much to prove before you are accepted by the Kindred you have defected to. Other vampires treat you with distrust and even hostility, and your reputation might even sully those whom you regularly associate with."}, {"ID":"144","MType":"Social","Name":"Blood Hunted (4)","Cost":"-4","IsMultiBuy":"0","HasNotes":"0","Descr":"You have been made the target of a blood hunt, and for you to return to your home city is death. For four points, this Flaw means that only your home city is off-limits to you. This Flaw can only be taken by Camarilla vampires."}, {"ID":"145","MType":"Social","Name":"Blood Hunted (6)","Cost":"-6","IsMultiBuy":"0","HasNotes":"0","Descr":"You have been made the target of a blood hunt, and for you to return to your home city is death. For six points, this Flaw means that the entire Camarilla is howling for your vitae. This Flaw can only be taken by Camarilla vampires."}, {"ID":"146","MType":"Social","Name":"Laughingstock","Cost":"-5","IsMultiBuy":"0","HasNotes":"0","Descr":"Somehow you\u2019ve drawn the scorn of the local Harpies, who make you their favorite target. You are at a +2 difficulty on all Social rolls in Elysium and a +1 anywhere else in the city. In addition, you are at +2 difficulty to use Intimidation or any Dominate powers on anyone who has heard the stories mocking you. This Flaw can only be taken by Camarilla vampires."}, {"ID":"147","MType":"Social","Name":"Red List","Cost":"-7","IsMultiBuy":"0","HasNotes":"0","Descr":"You are either being considered for or are already on the dreaded Red List, the registry of those vampires the Camarilla most wants extinguished. Any Camarilla vampire will either attack you on sight or, more likely, call in for a great deal of help."}, {"ID":"148","MType":"Supernatural","Name":"Deceptive Aura","Cost":"1","IsMultiBuy":"0","HasNotes":"0","Descr":"Your aura is unnaturally bright and colorful for a vampire. You register as a mortal on all attempts to read your aura."}, {"ID":"149","MType":"Supernatural","Name":"Healing Touch","Cost":"1","IsMultiBuy":"0","HasNotes":"0","Descr":"Normally vampires can only seal the wounds they inflict from feeding by licking them. With but a touch, you can achieve the same effect, closing the puncture wounds left by drinking blood."}, {"ID":"150","MType":"Supernatural","Name":"Inoffensive to Animals","Cost":"1","IsMultiBuy":"0","HasNotes":"0","Descr":"With rare exceptions, animals usually despise the Kindred. Some flee, others attack, but all dislike being in the presence of a vampire. You have no such problem. Animals may not enjoy being in your company, but they don\u2019t actively flee from you."}, {"ID":"151","MType":"Supernatural","Name":"Medium","Cost":"2","IsMultiBuy":"0","HasNotes":"0","Descr":"You possess the natural affinity to sense and hear spirits, ghosts, and shades. Though you cannot see them, you can sense them, speak to them and, through pleading or cajoling, draw them to your presence. You may call upon them for aid or advice, but there will always be a price. Also, your difficulty is reduced by two for all Awareness rolls involving the spirits of the dead."}, {"ID":"152","MType":"Supernatural","Name":"Magic Resistance","Cost":"2","IsMultiBuy":"0","HasNotes":"0","Descr":"You have an inherent resistance to the rituals of the Tremere and the spells of the mages of other Clans. The difficulty of all such magic, both malicious and beneficent, is two higher when directed at you. You may never learn magical Disciplines such as Thaumaturgy and Necromancy."}, {"ID":"153","MType":"Supernatural","Name":"Hidden Diablerie","Cost":"3","IsMultiBuy":"0","HasNotes":"0","Descr":"The tell-tale black streaks of diablerie do not manifest in your aura."}, {"ID":"154","MType":"Supernatural","Name":"Lucky","Cost":"3","IsMultiBuy":"0","HasNotes":"0","Descr":"You were born lucky - or else the Devil looks after his own. Either way, you may repeat any three failed rolls per story, including botches, but you may try only once per failed roll."}, {"ID":"155","MType":"Supernatural","Name":"Oracular Ability","Cost":"3","IsMultiBuy":"0","HasNotes":"0","Descr":"You can see and interpret signs and omens. You are able to draw advice from these omens, for they provide hints of the future and warnings of the present. When the Storyteller feels that you are in position to see an omen, you will be required to make a ^Perception + Awareness^ roll, with the difficulty relative to how well the omen is concealed. If successful, you may then roll ^Intelligence + Occult^ to interpret what you have seen; the difficulty is again relative to the complexity of the omen."}, {"ID":"156","MType":"Supernatural","Name":"Spirit Mentor","Cost":"3","IsMultiBuy":"0","HasNotes":"1","Descr":"You have a ghostly companion and guide. The identity and exact powers of this spirit are up to the Storyteller, but it can be called upon in difficult situations for help and guidance."}, {"ID":"157","MType":"Supernatural","Name":"True Love","Cost":"4","IsMultiBuy":"0","HasNotes":"1","Descr":"You have discovered, perhaps too late, a true love. He or she is mortal, but is the center of your existence, and inspires you to keep going in a world of darkness and despair. Whenever you suffer, the thought of your true love gives you the strength to persevere. This Merit grants you one automatic success on all Willpower rolls, which can be negated only by a botch die. This can be a great gift but also a hindrance, for your true love may require protection and occasionally rescue."}, {"ID":"158","MType":"Supernatural","Name":"Additional Discipline","Cost":"5","IsMultiBuy":"0","HasNotes":"1","Descr":"You can take one additional Discipline (Storyteller discretion) as if it were a Clan Discipline. All costs to learn that Discipline are paid out as if it were native to your Clan. A character cannot take this Merit more than once, and Caitiff vampires cannot take this Merit."}, {"ID":"159","MType":"Supernatural","Name":"Unbondable","Cost":"5","IsMultiBuy":"0","HasNotes":"0","Descr":"You are immune to being blood bound. Tremere cannot take this Merit."}, {"ID":"160","MType":"Supernatural","Name":"Nine Lives","Cost":"6","IsMultiBuy":"0","HasNotes":"1","Descr":"Fate has granted you the opportunity to come as close to Final Death as anyone can get and still survive. When a roll occurs that would result in your death, the roll is made again. If the next roll succeeds, then you live - and one of your nine lives is used up. If that subsequent roll fails, then another reroll is made, until either a successful roll occurs or your nine lives are used up. The Storyteller should keep careful count of how many lives the character has remaining."}, {"ID":"161","MType":"Supernatural","Name":"True Faith","Cost":"7","IsMultiBuy":"0","HasNotes":"0","Descr":"You have a deep-seated faith in and love for God, or whatever name you choose to call the Almighty. You begin the game with one point of True Faith (see the sidebar on p.372); this Trait adds one die per point to all Willpower and Virtue rolls. You must have a Humanity of 9 or higher to choose this Merit, and if you lose even a single point, all your Faith points are lost and may be regained only when the lost Humanity is recovered. Individuals with True Faith are capable of performing magical acts akin to miracles, but the exact nature of those acts are up to the Storyteller."}, {"ID":"162","MType":"Supernatural","Name":"Cast No Reflection","Cost":"-1","IsMultiBuy":"0","HasNotes":"0","Descr":"You actually cast no refection, just like the vampires of legend. This can have a detrimental effect when trying to pass as a human. Vampires of Clan Lasombra automatically have this Flaw (and you may be mistaken for one of them if you possess this)."}, {"ID":"163","MType":"Supernatural","Name":"Cold Breeze","Cost":"-1","IsMultiBuy":"0","HasNotes":"0","Descr":"A chill wind follows you everywhere you go. While it may make for dramatic entrances, this effect also discomfits mortals (+1 difficulty on all appropriate Social rolls) and marks you as obviously supernatural. Cold winds sweeping through executive offices or crowded nightclubs can raise all sorts of questions."}, {"ID":"164","MType":"Supernatural","Name":"Repulsed by Garlic","Cost":"-1","IsMultiBuy":"0","HasNotes":"0","Descr":"You cannot abide garlic, and the smallest whiff of its scent will drive you from a room unless you make a successful ^Willpower^ roll (difficulty based on the strength of the odor)."}, {"ID":"165","MType":"Supernatural","Name":"Touch of Frost","Cost":"-1","IsMultiBuy":"0","HasNotes":"0","Descr":"Plants wither as you approach and die at your touch. Your touch leeches heat from living beings, as though you were made of ice."}, {"ID":"166","MType":"Supernatural","Name":"Cursed (1)","Cost":"-1","IsMultiBuy":"1","HasNotes":"1","Descr":"You are the recipient of a supernatural curse. The strength and pervasiveness of the curse depends upon how many points you wish to incur.<br>Example: If you pass on a secret you were entrusted with, your betrayal will come back to harm you in some way (1 pt.)."}, {"ID":"167","MType":"Supernatural","Name":"Cursed (2)","Cost":"-2","IsMultiBuy":"1","HasNotes":"1","Descr":"You are the recipient of a supernatural curse. The strength and pervasiveness of the curse depends upon how many points you wish to incur.<br>Example: You stutter uncontrollably when you try to describe what you have seen or heard (2 pts.)."}, {"ID":"168","MType":"Supernatural","Name":"Cursed (3)","Cost":"-3","IsMultiBuy":"1","HasNotes":"1","Descr":"You are the recipient of a supernatural curse.

The strength and pervasiveness of the curse depends upon how many points you wish to incur.<br>Example: Every one of your accomplishments or triumphs will eventually become soiled or fail in some way. (5pts.)"}, {"ID":"171","MType":"Supernatural","Name":"Beacon of the Unholy","Cost":"-2","IsMultiBuy":"0","HasNotes":"0","Descr":"You radiate palpable evil. Clergy and devout mortals know instinctively that there is something horribly wrong with you, and react accordingly."}, {"ID":"172","MType":"Supernatural","Name":"Deathsight","Cost":"-2","IsMultiBuy":"0","HasNotes":"0","Descr":"Everything appears rotted and decayed to you. The world appears to you as a corpse; mortals look diseased or skeletal, buildings seem decrepit, and your fellow Kindred seem to be walking, moldering cadavers. You are at -2 difficulty to resist all rolls based on Appearance, but by the same token you are at +2 difficulty on all Perception-based rolls. In addition, you find social interaction difficult and are at +1 difficulty on all Social-based rolls."}, {"ID":"173","MType":"Supernatural","Name":"Eerie Presence","Cost":"-2","IsMultiBuy":"0","HasNotes":"0","Descr":"Mortals have an unconscious awareness of your undead nature, which makes them anxious and ill at ease in your presence. Because of this, difficulties of all rolls relating to social interaction with mortals are increased by two."}, {"ID":"174","MType":"Supernatural","Name":"Lord of the Flies","Cost":"-2","IsMultiBuy":"0","HasNotes":"0","Descr":"Buzzing harbingers of decay swirl around you everywhere. Their constant presence makes it difficult for you to interact socially (+1 difficulty when appropriate) and nearly impossible to sneak up on someone or hide effectively. The buzzing of the flies inevitably gives you away - all Stealth rolls are at +2 difficulty."}, {"ID":"175","MType":"Supernatural","Name":"Can\u2019t Cross Running Water","Cost":"-3","IsMultiBuy":"0","HasNotes":"0","Descr":"You believe in the old folklore, and cannot cross running water unless you are at least 50 feet (15 meters) above it. Running water is considered to be any body of water at least two feet (half a meter) wide in any direction and not completely stagnant."}, {"ID":"176","MType":"Supernatural","Name":"Haunted","Cost":"-3","IsMultiBuy":"0","HasNotes":"1","Descr":"You are haunted by an angry and tormented spirit, most likely one of your first victims. This spirit actively attempts to hinder you, especially when feeding, and does its utmost to vent its anguish upon you and anyone in your presence. The Storyteller determines the exact nature of the spirit, its powers, and whether or not it can eventually be laid to rest."}, {"ID":"177","MType":"Supernatural","Name":"Repelled by Crosses","Cost":"-3","IsMultiBuy":"0","HasNotes":"0","Descr":"You are repelled by the sight of ordinary crosses, believing them to be symbols of holy might. When confronted by a cross, you must make a ^Willpower^ roll (difficulty 9) or flee from the symbol for the duration of the scene. If you botch the roll, not only must you attempt to flee, but the touch of the cross can cause aggravated damage (one health level of damage per turn that the cross touches your skin). This damage cannot be soaked, even if the vampire possesses Fortitude."}, {"ID":"178","MType":"Supernatural","Name":"Grip of the Damned","Cost":"-4","IsMultiBuy":"0","HasNotes":"0","Descr":"There is no ecstasy in your Embrace - only terror and pain. Mortals upon whom you feed struggle and shriek while you attempt to feed, requiring you to grapple with them for as long as you wish to take their blood. For vampires with high Humanity, this experience may require a ^Humanity^ roll, at the discretion of the Storyteller. Giovanni cannot take this Flaw."}, {"ID":"179","MType":"Supernatural","Name":"Dark Fate","Cost":"-5","IsMultiBuy":"0","HasNotes":"0","Descr":"You are doomed to experience Final Death or, worse, suffer eternal agony. No matter what you do, you cannot avoid this terrible fate. At some point during the chronicle, your Dark Fate will come upon you. Even more ghastly is the fact that you occasionally have visions of this fate, and the malaise these images inspire requires an expenditure of a temporary Willpower point to avoid, or else you lose a die from all of your actions for the remainder of the night. It is up to the Storyteller to determine the exact nature of this fate, and when it will occur. This is a difficult Flaw to roleplay; ironically, though it may seem as though it removes all free will, the knowledge of one\u2019s death can be quite liberating."}, {"ID":"180","MType":"Supernatural","Name":"Light-Sensitive","Cost":"-5","IsMultiBuy":"0","HasNotes":"0","Descr":"You are even more sensitive to sunlight than other vampires are. Sunlight causes double normal damage, and the light of the moon can cause lethal damage in a manner similar to the sun, though it must shine directly upon you. Even bright lights hurt your eyes, requiring the use of sunglasses. Followers of Set and related bloodlines cannot take this Flaw, as they already have a worse version of it."}, {"ID":"181","MType":"Additional","Name":"Intolerance (1F)","Cost":"-1","IsMultiBuy":"1","HasNotes":"1","Descr":"GM additional.
