The flip side of Escaped Target, two vampires wanted to gift you with the Embrace. One succeeded, one failed - and she’s not happy about that failure. You, your actual sire, or both of you have become the target of the failed suitor’s ire. Regardless, your persecutor is at +2 difficulty to refrain from frenzy in your presence. In addition, she may well be working actively to discredit or destroy you.
