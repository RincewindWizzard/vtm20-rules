Conscience is a Trait that allows characters to evaluate their conduct with relation to what is “right” and “wrong”. A character’s moral judgment with Conscience stems from her attitude and outlook. Conscience is what prevents a vampire from succumbing to the Beast, by defining the Beast’s urges as unacceptable.<br>Conscience factors into the difficulty of many rolls to avoid committing a transgression. Additionally, Conscience determines whether or not a character loses Humanity by committing acts that do not uphold her moral code (see “Degeneration”, p.309). A character with a high Conscience rating feels remorse for transgressions, while a character with a lower Conscience may be more callous or ethically lax.<br>Some vampires replace the Conscience Virtue with the Virtue of Conviction (p. 314); unless your Storyteller tells you it’s OK to do this, assume Conscience is used.
