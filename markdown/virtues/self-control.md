Self-Control defines a character’s discipline and mastery over the Beast. Characters with high Self-Control rarely succumb to emotional urges, and are thus able to restrain their darker sides more readily than characters with low Self-Control. Self-Control comes into play when a character faces her Beast in the form of frenzy (p. 298). Self-Control allows the character to resist the frenzy. Note: A character may never roll more dice to resist or control a frenzy than she has in her blood pool - it’s hard to deny the Beast when one’s mind clouds with hunger. As with Conscience, Self-Control can be replaced, in this case by the Virtue of Instinct (p. 314). Again, unless the Storyteller specifically says it’s all right to do so, assume Self-Control is used.
