The Hobby Talent category encompasses anything that the Storyteller deems to be mainly self-taught and is usually (though not always) more active than intellectual. Storytellers should first examine the list of existing Talents to determine if a particular activity might fall under one of those (for example, Swimming and Climbing would be specialties of Athletics).
_Suggested Hobby Talents_: Carousing, Diplomacy, Fortune Telling, Negotiation, Scrounging
