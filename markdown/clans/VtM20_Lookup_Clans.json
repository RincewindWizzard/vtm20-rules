Outside the purview of the Sects, the Assamites are true independents and mercenaries, hiring out to whoever can pay their blood-price and ungoverned by the will of Prince or Priscus. By the time a mark realizes that he\u2019s being hunted by an Assamite, it\u2019s often far too late. Needless to say, this makes the Assamites both feared and reviled by many of the other Clans.<\/p><p>In truth, the Assamites are more than simple thugs and killers. Theirs is a complex but insular Clan predicated upon the three principles of wisdom, sorcery, and diablerie. Most Assamites that other vampires encounter are members of the warrior caste, however, so Kindred society has painted them all with that brush. For their part, the Assassins have done nothing to stop this misunderstanding. If it helps them acquire contracts and it occludes the true nature of their Clan, the better for them.<\/p><p>Long ago, the Assamites were brought to heel by a powerful curse to curb their bloodlust, levied by the Tremere at the behest of the Camarilla. They cannot taste the vitae of vampires without it causing them harm. In their ongoing quest to lower their Generation and bring themselves closer to their holy figure, Haqim (whom some outside scholars claim was of the Second Generation, while others insist he was a judge appointed by the other Antediluvians), the Assamites must refine the blood of Kindred into an alchemical solution. Were it not for this mystical yoke, the Assamites would surely be unchecked on a crusade of unholy diablerie.<p><p><b>Nickname:<\/b> Assassins<\/p><p><b>Sect:<\/b> For the most part, the Assamites tend to be independent, letting the Sects hire them to operate on their own terms. That said, some Assamites believe an allegiance with the Camarilla or the Sabbat would allow the entire Clan to stand more strongly.<\/p><p><b>Appearance<\/b>: Older Assamites often come from Middle Eastern and North African cultures, though more and more young Assamites come from a wider demographic. In traditional environments, the Assamites prefer garb appropriate to religious or Clan custom. When in public, however, Assamites wear whatever the locals do, allowing them to fulfill their contracts without anyone noticing anything amiss. An Assamite\u2019s skin grows darker with age (as opposed to other vampires, whose skin gets paler); particularly ancient Assamites are almost ebony in complexion.<\/p><p><b>Haven:<\/b> Assamites often share communal havens with others of their local cell, remote structures that allow the Assassins to watch the larger domain from a distance. These havens are generally well appointed, but not so lavish that the whole place can\u2019t be moved on short notice. Individual Assamites also tend to keep personal hideouts of a much more humble nature, for when they need a place to lay low.<\/p><p><b>Background:<\/b> Those Embraced into Clan Assamite tend to fall into two distinct types: The \u201cprovincial\u201d members of the Clan fit whatever their locality is, and can blend seamlessly in with the people around them. The higher-profile \u201cjet-setters\u201d transcend cultures, bolstered by their ability to handle interpersonal and intellectual challenges.<\/p><p><b>Character Creation:<\/b> Physical Attributes tend to be primary, with some Assamites favoring Social Attributes to help them get close to their prey. Talents and Skills are equally favored, but Knowledges may help the wise Assamite in a pinch. Few Assassins cultivate extensive Backgrounds, and instead specialize in an array of Disciplines that heighten their competence. The most accomplished Assamites follow the Clan\u2019s unique Path of Enlightenment, and those who don\u2019t often have to spend a great deal of effort maintaining their Virtues and Humanity.<\/p><p><b>Clan Disciplines:<\/b> Celerity, Obfuscate, Quietus<\/p><p><b>Weaknesses:<\/b> Due to the Tremere blood-curse, should an Assamite consume the blood of another Kindred, she suffers one automatic level of unsoakable lethal damage per blood point imbibed.

In addition, Assamites must tithe some of the profits from their contracts to their sires or superiors (generally around 10 percent of all such earnings).<\/p><p><b>Organization:<\/b> An insular, hierarchical organization shapes much of Assamite custom. \u201cThe Old Man on the Mountain\u201d \u2014 the master assassin who makes his haven in the mountain fortress of Alamut \u2014 is the ultimate authority, and the Clan heeds the orders that trickle down to them with a mix of reverence and terror.

Theirs was the glory of ancient Carthage, but Ventrue treachery in ancient Rome brought the dream to an end. Since then, the Brujah have borne a grudge.<\/p><p>Tonight, the Brujah are rebels and provocateurs, bat-swinging hooligans and agents of change in a society long crippled by stasis. As rebels, it\u2019s in their nature to challenge the status quo \u2014 though sometimes, without adequate opposition, they embody the status quo themselves. It works out fine, because there\u2019s always a hot-blooded Brujah waiting in the wings to bring down an uppity Clanmate grown too comfortable in the role of rebel-turned-dictator.<\/p><p>More so than any other Clan, the Brujah still feel the flames of the passions that once inspired them as mortals. Clan Brujah loves a cause and is quick to act on a stirring speech, accusation of injustice, or a call to arms. This connection to passion can be a blessing, but inspiration can also yield to the madness and hunger of the Beast.<\/p><p>No wise Prince turns his back on the Brujah, and rare is the Brujah who would allow herself to be manipulated or pandered to. A Brujah is her own master, first and foremost, and those who would bring her to heel face a terrible task. A Brujah who thinks she\u2019s getting the short end of the stick will tear an enemy to ribbons first and maybe remember to ask questions later, no matter if he\u2019s a Primogen or a mortal authority.<\/p><p>Some Kindred historians claim that the Brujah have parlayed their ancient betrayal into a role as agitators against the very order that they help support. Others claim the Brujah have long since submitted to the will of that same order, being little more than loyal opposition rendered impotent. Most Brujah don\u2019t care either way, as long as someone needs a good ass-kicking and they can be the ones to deliver it.<\/p><p><b>Nickname:<\/b> Rabble<\/p><p><b>Sect:<\/b> For all its rebellion, Clan Brujah generally considers itself a member of the Camarilla. Young Rabble sometimes look to the wildness of the Sabbat, but elders assert that the Ivory Tower provides a fine structure against which to rage.<\/p><p><b>Appearance:<\/b> Many Brujah affect styles and mannerisms that reflect an attitude of rebellion. Multicolored hair, shaven heads, spikes, rivets, fetish gear, and t-shirts with bold slogans might appeal to a Brujah. While not every Brujah wears the \u201cuniform,\u201d the Rabble often enjoy adorning themselves in outfits intended to provoke. Some young Brujah prefer mobile devices as their tools of resistance, and can summon a riot at the touch of a screen.<\/p><p><b>Haven:<\/b> Brujah may feel kinship to a city, but they rarely develop such ties to individual locations. Thus, at any given time, a Brujah probably has a half-dozen or more hideouts, safehouses, and flats available. These are often shabby and ill-kept until the Brujah needs them. Brujah havens might also have mortals who follow the Brujah\u2019s ideology or his cult of personality. This works out fine: It never hurts to have a spare vessel in an emergency.<\/p><p><b>Background:<\/b> As creatures of passion, Brujah often Embrace without really thinking much about it, and their childer tend to be a disparate lot. Sometimes, the Rabble Embrace those who share a similar outlook or enthusiasm for a cause as the prospective sire. Other times, they inflict the Embrace on those of opposite ideology, cursing a rival with vampirism as punishment.<\/p><p><b>Character Creation:<\/b> Brujah are usually \u2014 though not exclusively \u2014 drawn from mortals with violent or ungovernable personalities. Their Natures and Demeanors are often similar, as Brujah have little use for guile. They lean toward physical Attributes, with Social and Mental about equal afterwards. Many favor Skills and Talents, but most respect the Knowledges that make them more than just thugs. Contacts, Allies, and Herd are common Backgrounds.<\/p><p><b>Clan Disciplines:<\/b> Celerity, Potence, Presence<\/p><p><b>Weaknesses:<\/b> The same passions that inspire Brujah to greatness or depravity, left unchecked, can send them into incandescent rages: The difficulties of rolls to resist or guide frenzy (p. 298) are two higher than normal.

Iconoclasts want to tear it all down, while Idealists enjoy solving problems through theory. This last harkens somewhat to the classical roots of the Brujah as philosopher-kings, and most Idealists are among the ranks of Brujah ancillae and elders.<\/p><div class=ttlStereo><h3>Stereotypes<\/h3><p><b>Assamite:<\/b> <i>Fast, invisible, fanatical, and they want to drink my fucking blood?

Pimps, pushers, and priests, the Setites cater to the needs of the desperate, and convert them to a nihilistic cause in doing so. Whether one needs flesh, money, drugs, or dark secrets, the Followers of Set can provide it, and when they do so, they all but guarantee themselves a return visit from those who seek them.<\/p><p>The Followers of Set are as much a chthonic religion as they are a Clan, though the faith includes the Clan. Its mythology is complex and convoluted, an impenetrable pantheon of god-monsters. At the apex of this worship stands a syncretism of the Egyptian Lord of the Underworld Set and the Greek hydra Typhon, as much spiritual guardians of secret places as they are the \u201cliberators\u201d of other\u2019s souls. To outsiders, this is all blasphemous religious affectation, but to devout Setites, the cult and cause are real, and their dark lord works his will through them.<\/p><p>Needless to say, the politics of desperation and the placation of evil gods place the Serpents on the outside of Kindred society. The Setites are fine with this. The Kindred can often find themselves in need of what the Followers of Set purvey, and the extra \u201cservice\u201d of secrecy is one the Setites are happy to provide \u2014 at a premium. The Setites offer a devil\u2019s deal, but on their own terms. That way, when they collect their due and feed blood and souls into the maw of the Typhonic beast, all of its sacrifices have been given willingly.<\/p><p><b>Nickname:<\/b> Setites, Serpents<\/p><p><b>Sect:<\/b> Externally, none of the Sects will have the Followers of Set. Internally, the Setites sometimes describe themselves in terms of both Sect and Clan. They have no real impetus to join either the Camarilla or Sabbat, and their goals are different from those of the Anarchs.<\/p><p><b>Appearance:<\/b> Many older Setites hail from the North African and Mediterranean ethnicities native to the Serpents\u2019 historical territory, but they freely Embrace from among the mortals of their adopted homes. Some long-standing Setite temples are tied to locations where \u201cEgyptian\u201d Serpents might seem out of place, but where some aspect of serpent mythology is present, as in Mesoamerica or even far-flung Nordic locales, and thus draw their membership from local populations. Red hair is considered a mark of Set\u2019s favor.<\/p><p><b>Haven:<\/b> Where their hidden temples stand, the Setites make their havens, either individually or communally. These may be anything from \u201cchurches\u201d with never-before-heard-of denominations or they may be outright cults that have to hide their existences. The secretive Serpents sometimes hide individual havens in places where other Kindred don\u2019t often go, such as insular ethnic neighborhoods, abandoned domains, \u201cthe rough part of town,\u201d and so forth. Some Setites also haven in secret mystical places that have value to the Clan, guarding them from outsiders.<\/p><p><b>Background:<\/b> Prospective childer for the Followers of Set often spend some time involved with a Setite cult, so they\u2019re indoctrinated in the mysteries of the Clan before becoming one of its Kindred. They may come from any cultural origin, though many are outsiders, loners, or otherwise marginalized by society, which is often what led them to the forbidden fruits offered by the cult of Set in the first place.<\/p><p><b>Character Creation:<\/b> Sires choose those who demonstrate acumen in Social and Mental Attributes, as the Clan needs its proselytizers and its priests to be charismatic and quick-witted. Knowledges are almost always primary, though Talents may be so instead, especially among those Serpents engaged in dealings with others. Setites focus on Backgrounds that give influence over others whether subtly or overtly, making Allies, Contacts, Influence, Resources, and sometimes Retainers popular.<\/p><p><b>Clan Disciplines:<\/b> Obfuscate, Presence, Serpentis<\/p><p><b>Weaknesses:<\/b> Given their origins in darkness, the Serpents react negatively to bright light: Add two health levels to damage caused by exposure to sunlight.

Setites in the cities rarely scheme among each other, preferring to face outward threats in unity rather than the schismatic self-interest of the Sects. Whispers persist of a massive temple devoted to Set located somewhere in Africa, with a terrible Methuselah who claims to be the childe of Set himself at the head.

Indeed, the Outlanders may develop the ability to transform themselves into these and other, more primal forms.<\/p><p>The Gangrel have other characteristics in common with animals as well. Many shun the elaborate social constructs of both Kindred and kine. A number of them prefer to move alone or as a member of small packs or coteries. Most are tough and, when pressed, ferocious. And when Gangrel succumb to the depredations of the Beast, they are left with some feature redolent of the animal kingdom.<\/p><p>As a Clan, the Gangrel are wary and aloof. Most would prefer to spend their nights stalking prey or wilding on the rooftops than minding Princely edicts or lobbying for recognition of domain. Theirs is a tense relationship with vampire society, and Outlanders are among the most frequent to turn Anarch or Autarkis. In some localities, the Gangrel have collectively abandoned membership in any Sect \u2014 insofar as the Gangrel truly ever do anything collectively.<\/p><p>The Jyhad seems less pronounced among the Gangrel than it is among other Clans, and the Outlanders have little regard for the eternal conflict. Differences between Gangrel more often fall along the lines of domain and feeding rights than they do on generational mistrust, and the things that concern young Outlanders are matters that concern Gangrel ancillae and even elders. Still, one would be hard-pressed to consider the relationship among Gangrel of different generations amicable, except in isolated sire-childe situations. The Beast is ever suspicious of those who would take sustenance from it.<\/p><p><b>Nickname:<\/b> Outlanders<\/p><p><b>Sect:<\/b> The Gangrel at least nominally belong to the Camarilla, but the Clan has always had a vocal faction that spurns membership in any Sect.

The Clan\u2019s weakness can contribute a great deal to their appearance, as does an extended unlife in the places where they make their havens, which are frequently short of modern conveniences.<\/p><p><b>Haven:<\/b> Gangrel often lair where they can, taking refuge when the sun threatens to rise. Those who do maintain permanent havens often lean toward the utilitarian: Everything from a cave to a covered alley to an illegal squat may serve as a Gangrel haven, usually with little demarcating them as any sort of personal territory (until it\u2019s too late for the unfortunate interloper).<\/p><p><b>Background:<\/b> Gangrel sire childer like they seek prey: after long hunts during which the prospective childe doesn\u2019t even know she\u2019s being followed.

However, with the family\u2019s rise came hubris, as its paterfamilias sought ever more power, and with that hubris came horror. With his earthly power at its apex, Augustus Giovanni turned to the arts of controlling the dead, and in doing so, gained the Embrace from a forgotten Antediluvian. With a conclave of conspirators, the Giovanni plunged a now-forgotten Clan into oblivion and built their own legacy on its corpse.<\/p><p>Since those first nights, the Giovanni have accepted no limits on their ambitions, despite opposition from Kindred outside their Clan and a well-deserved reputation as \u201cDevil Kindred.\u201d They studied forbidden arts, becoming formidable in the nigrimancy that allowed them power over the spirits of the departed, and degeneracy followed in the wake of unclean ritual. To this night, the Giovanni are known for the insular nature of their Clan and the incestuous practices by which they populate it. A few outside families and factions fall under Giovanni auspices, but the vast majority of the Clan comes from the debased mortal family. The family remains successful despite all of their ghastly peccadilloes, and has amassed a vast wealth through crime, politics, and the secrets of the dead that keeps them in their position of degraded opulence.<\/p><p>In public view, the Giovanni make a great show of humility and respect. Part of this gentility is a habit of centuries, still in place from when the other Clans hunted the usurping Necromancers (and to preserve their hard-won neutrality from the conflict between the Camarilla and the Sabbat). Another part of it is the velvet glove hiding the iron fist of their nature, remarkable for forcing ghosts, minds, and bodies alike to bow to their needs. To hear the Giovanni tell it, Princes and Archbishops alike owe them favors, and anyone with something to offer may earn their patronage.<\/p><p>For the most part, the Giovanni participate little in the Jyhad, pursuing their own agenda of cultivating wealth and building a foundation of power in the lands beyond the veil of death. Outsiders rarely comprehend the goals of the Necromancers, but only the most trusted of the Giovanni know that the Clan wants to plunge the world into a state where the dead and the living commingle. And with their mastery of Necromancy, the Giovanni would be positioned to rule it all.<\/p><p><b>Nickname:<\/b> Necromancers<\/p><p><b>Appearance:<\/b> Outwardly, Giovanni dress with subtlety and taste. Much of the Clan comes from the original mortal family, and have not only olive Italian complexions, but some amount of inherited family features. Those outside the immediate family often appear \u201cof a type,\u201d and in the traditional garb of their regional family branch.<\/p><p><b>Haven:<\/b> The family wealth of the Giovanni is evident in their havens, which may take the form of villas or lavish estates. The Necromancers often have valuables invested in their havens as well, such as galleries of fine art or displays of jewelry. Many Giovanni also maintain secondary havens, where they may have elaborate necromantic crypts or just flats where they can lie low if necessary.<\/p><p><b>Background:<\/b> Giovanni of the main family branch have usually spent some amount of time as a ghoul in a practice known as the Proxy Kiss. During this time, the Kindred-to-be learns about the treacherous and jealous reality of the vampire family. She learns ambition and an unhealthy dose of duplicity, in addition to the family history and customs. Giovanni rarely see much of the outside world on their own terms during the Proxy Kiss period, and often become insular and alienated, while at the same time eager to stand out among the other family ghouls.<\/p><p><b>Character Creation:<\/b> Giovanni vampires often have outgoing, professional Demeanors that hide unpleasant Natures warped in their upbringing. Social or Mental Attributes are usually primary, though some of the \u201csoldiers\u201d of the family prefer Physical Attributes. Emphasis likewise usually falls on primary Knowledges or Talents, depending on proclivity. A split in the Clan sees those who favor the practicality of Backgrounds (particularly those tied to wealth and exerting influence) diverge from those who prefer the forbidden puissance of Disciplines.

The family maintains an enormous palazzo known as the Mausoleum in Venice, where elders and fledglings alike dance to the whims of their ancient puppetmasters. Clan structure is itself familial, with the added complications that degeneracy and vampirism offer. Incest, ancestor worship, necrophilia, cults of guilt, and bizarre relationships in which fathers and grandmothers are their own issue\u2019s childer make a mire of the Clan and family, and fracture many Giovanni long before they become Kindred.<\/p><div class=ttlStereo><h3>Stereotypes<\/h3><p><b>Assamite:<\/b> <i>Beware, as all the money in the world still cannot buy one passage back from the grave.<\/i><\/p><p><b>Brujah:<\/b> <i>Inexpensive allies or irascible enemies.<\/i><\/p><p><b>Followers of Set:<\/b> <i>Dangerous relics deluded by a primitive grasp of what lies beyond the Shroud.<\/i><\/p><p><b>Gangrel:<\/b> <i>Let them have their mud and misery.<\/i><\/p><p><b>Lasombra:<\/b> <i>Like us, they stand with one foot in the temporal world and one foot in the occult.<\/i><\/p><p><b>Malkavian:<\/b> <i>Once they crumble to dust, they don\u2019t have to suffer their madness anymore.<\/i><\/p><p><b>Nosferatu:<\/b> <i>Dead men do tell tales, and the Sewer Rats have so many tales to tell.<\/i><\/p><p><b>Ravnos:<\/b> <i>The Kindred have forever to make of their fates what they will, and this is how they spend it?<\/i><\/p><p><b>Toreador:<\/b> <i>How tragic is the Kindred so desperately afraid of what she truly is.<\/i><\/p><p><b>Tremere:<\/b> <i>We don\u2019t enshrine the history that made us what we are, so why do they?<\/i><\/p><p><b>Tzimisce:<\/b> <i>The worm that feasts on its own flesh must eventually starve.<\/i><\/p><p><b>Ventrue:<\/b> <i>They often forget that Machiavelli worked in the wake of the Borgias and the Medicis.<\/i><\/p><p><b>Caitiff:<\/b> <i>Without knowing their origins, what can they possibly amount to?<\/i><\/p><p><b>Camarilla and Sabbat:<\/b> <i>Let them have their endless war, for we grow rich by selling each side what it needs to continue the effort.<\/i><\/p><p><b>Anarchs:<\/b> <i>Until they build something of lasting import, they are the ugliest of the sisters.<\/i><\/p><\/div><p class=ttlQuote><b>Quote:<\/b> <i>You misunderstand the situation if you think you\u2019re important to me alive.<\/i><\/p>"}, {"ID":"6","Name":"Lasombra","IsUgly":"0","ClanDiscID1":"6","ClanDiscID2":"10","ClanDiscID3":"11","ClanDiscID4":null,"WeaknessShort":"Cast no reflection","WeaknessLong":"Lasombra vampires cast no reflections.

Fear, frenzy, the power to determine whether another lives or dies: these are at the root of the power that the Lasombra hold dear. Whereas other vampires try vainly to hold the Beast at bay or give themselves wholly to it, the Lasombra beat the Beast into submission, invoking it when it suits them but leaving it trapped inside when they wish to govern themselves.<\/p><p>It is with these predilections that the Lasombra style themselves a \u201cdark nobility,\u201d an aristocracy of the night that chose the supremacy of the Cainites over veneration of the Masquerade. Their regard for such ideas as redemption and salvation are cynical at best, and much of the pomp that shaped the Clan\u2019s pre-Sabbat outlook remains only with a sense of blackest irony or open mockery. The grandeur and rituals of the Church and aristocracy remain dear to the Lasombra, however, and the Clan was instrumental not only in establishing many of the rituals of the Sabbat, but in the institutions that keep it from descending into chaos each night.<\/p><p>Whether they see themselves as God\u2019s instruments or as outcasts from His creation, the Lasombra believe they have a duty (whether to Sect, Clan, pack, or even just themselves), and obligation to their responsibilities gives them a wicked sense of purpose. Even a Lasombra shovelhead may consider himself a cut above the rest; a surprising number of Lasombra mass Embraces survive, perhaps owing to the intervention of their sires.<\/p><p>While the night belongs to all Kindred, the Lasombra are truly born to darkness, to the degree that their very Clan name reveals their tie to shadow. Theirs is the Discipline of Obtenebration, and it allows them to wield the stuff of shadow and darkness, and even reach beyond the darkness of the physical world into the abyss that lies beyond.<\/p><p><b>Nickname:<\/b> Keepers (as in \u201cmy brother\u2019s...\u201d)<\/p><p><b>Sect:<\/b> The Sabbat would be very different without the influence of the Lasombra, and they remain its most prominent Clan. Young Lasombra often make auspicious starts as Sabbat Ducti or Priests, leading their fellows by charging into the fray or demonstrating mastery of the Beast.<\/p><p><b>Appearance:<\/b> The Lasombra are frequently attractive. Whether through the Spanish, Italian, and Moorish stock associated with the Clan, or due to more cosmopolitan modern backgrounds, the Keepers cut a striking figure. Their dress is often conservative or religious, drawing on years of ceremony and faithful ritual. Rare is the Lasombra who cannot at least manipulate shadows to affect a dramatic entrance or enigmatic pose.<\/p><p><b>Haven:<\/b> The obligation of their leadership leads many young Lasombra to maintain communal havens with other members of their pack. Wealthier Keepers and those who predate the Sect often maintain their own havens, whether sinister penthouse suites or sprawling Old World villas.<\/p><p><b>Background:<\/b> Prospective sires of Clan Lasombra seek both erudition and ambition in their potential childer. As such, many Lasombra come from professional backgrounds, and display outgoing and even aggressive personalities. Merit in their sires\u2019 eyes takes fledgling Lasombra far, and the Keepers do not hesitate to cull their ranks of flawed, lazy, or boorish childer.<\/p><p><b>Character Creation:<\/b> Lasombra often have disparate Natures and Demeanors. Mental or Social Attributes are equally likely to be primary. Attributes tend to be narrow and specialized, showing individual expertise. Keepers cultivate Backgrounds of all types similarly in (initially) low quantities, to better diversify themselves.<\/p><p><b>Clan Disciplines:<\/b> Dominate, Obtenebration, Potence<\/p><p><b>Weaknesses:<\/b> Lasombra vampires cast no reflections.

A complex system of patronage, mentorship, and lineage characterizes the Clan, similar to the courts and churches of centuries gone by. Childer benefit greatly from esteemed sires and vice versa, while acts that confer Sect or Clan status may also elevate a Lasombra\u2019s peers, so long as she associates her success with her fellows.<\/p><div class=ttlStereo><h3>Stereotypes<\/h3><p><b>Assamite:<\/b> <i>They believe themselves lions but possess only the ways of jackals.<\/i><\/p><p><b>Brujah:<\/b> <i>Petulant whelps in a rage over their own loss of rule from a self-fulfilling prophecy.<\/i><\/p><p><b>Followers of Set:<\/b> <i>Peer too deeply into the darkness, serpent, and you shall find that it has the means to smite.<\/i><\/p><p><b>Gangrel:<\/b> <i>Every society needs its beasts of burden.<\/i><\/p><p><b>Giovanni:<\/b> <i>Their inner foulness manifests in their every action.<\/i><\/p><p><b>Malkavian:<\/b> <i>The fool does not dine at the table with the lords.<\/i><\/p><p><b>Nosferatu:<\/b> <i>They are martyrs, not monsters, and their faces are the stigmata they must bear.<\/i><\/p><p><b>Ravnos:<\/b> <i>Filth, suitable only from which to make an example.<\/i><\/p><p><b>Toreador:<\/b> <i>A rose plucked from its garden remains lovely for only so long before it crumbles to dust.<\/i><\/p><p><b>Tremere:<\/b> <i>They revere only themselves, and they will reap a just reward for the sacrilege they practice.<\/i><\/p><p><b>Tzimisce:<\/b> <i>Although we may share a common goal, a murder of crows is always an ill omen.<\/i><\/p><p><b>Ventrue:<\/b> <i>Such a misguided effort, to use the scepter of kings only to hide oneself from his lessers.<\/i><\/p><p><b>Caitiff:<\/b> <i>Lords have ever sired bastards, and have ever hidden them as their marks of shame.<\/i><\/p><p><b>Camarilla:<\/b> <i>Who would wish to dwell in a castle that closes its gates for fear of unruly peasants?<\/i><\/p><p><b>Sabbat:<\/b> <i>Imperfect, and thus in need of ever more investment.<\/i><\/p><p><b>Anarchs:<\/b> <i>They must never be equals \u2014 it is enough that they think they are.<\/i><\/p><\/div><p class=ttlQuote><b>Quote:<\/b> <i>Wielding the shadows is an extension of controlling the darkness into which we are all Embraced.<\/i><\/p>"}, {"ID":"7","Name":"Malkavian","IsUgly":"0","ClanDiscID1":"2","ClanDiscID2":"5","ClanDiscID3":"9","ClanDiscID4":null,"WeaknessShort":"Permanent, incurable derangement","WeaknessLong":"All members of Clan Malkavian suffer from a permanent, incurable derangement.

Upon the Embrace, every Malkavian is afflicted with an insurmountable insanity that fractures her outlook for every night thereafter, making her unlife one of madness. Some consider this a form of oracular insight, while others simply consider them dangerous.<\/p><p>Make no mistake: Malkavian insanity is a painful, alienating phenomenon, but it occasionally provides the Lunatics with bursts of insight or heretofore unknown perspective. Madness for the Malkavians may take the form of any clinical form of insanity, or it may be a hyperacuity of senses others don\u2019t know they have; a supernatural puppeteer pulling the Malkavian\u2019s strings, or a sense that the Malkavian is somehow ahead of evolutionary schedule. A Malkavian may believe herself to be an idea given physical form or an avatar of some concept the World of Darkness has yet to encounter. She may be a nonstop ravening psychopath, or may be a mostly lucid individual sometimes rendered catatonic by fear of an impending cosmic cataclysm.<\/p><p>Their precarious stability makes it hard for other Kindred (or, indeed, any vessels with whom they may meet) to interact with Malkavians. The Clan sometimes indulges in elaborate, terrifying, and dangerous \u201cpranks\u201d which do little to endear them to other vampires. These incidents are nominally meant to educate the target, but the lesson can often be lost between the vampire\u2019s scramble for safety and the inability to parse the Malkavian\u2019s inner logic. Common pranks might be to replace a vain Toreador\u2019s haven door with a guillotine or to redistribute a Brujah elder\u2019s wealth while he\u2019s at Elysium, or it might take the form of giving a hunter the location where the Nosferatu gather. Kindred both dread and resent the word \u201cprank\u201d almost as much as they do the Lunatics themselves.<\/p><p><b>Nickname:<\/b> Lunatics<\/p><p><b>Sect:<\/b> In their moments of lucidity, the Malkavians offer their unorthodox perspectives and Devil\u2019s advocacy to the Camarilla, offering their visions and unique insights to cut through the webs of deceit. Princes and Primogen tolerate the Lunatics to varying degrees, but the Clan as a whole has always been a supporter of the Ivory Tower.<\/p><p><b>Appearance:<\/b> While Malkavians can come from any culture, the madness following the Embrace tends to lead them to extremes of self-presentation. Malkavians may appear disheveled, injured, or simply dirty. They could still be wearing the same clothes from the night of their Embrace or they may have stolen clothes from a laundromat or a department store during a fit of confusion or fugue. Of course, Malkavians are just as likely to be meticulous and exacting in their appearance, trying obsessively to appear as normal as possible.<\/p><p><b>Haven:<\/b> Consistency is rare among Malkavians. Quite simply, they establish havens where they think to, where they can, and where they can recall. A significant number of Malkavians have literally no home, spending each night where exhaustion or the sun\u2019s rays leave them. Others may permanently have the presidential suite in a posh hotel, a squat in the Barrens, the dispensary at a county jail, or a broom closet in a historical landmark.<\/p><p><b>Background:<\/b> Malkavians Embrace with all the caprice one would assume from them. Lunatic childer come from all economic and cultural strata, though most have some sort of hard-luck story or black secret behind them that caused their sire to take note. Truly damaged Malkavians who are unaware of the meanings of their actions may not even be aware that they have sired childer, which makes for very difficult entry into Kindred society for these castoffs, many of whom end up among the Caitiff.<\/p><p><b>Character Creation:<\/b> Loner, outsider, and deviant concepts and archetypes prevail among the Malkavians, as do Mental Attributes (with an occasional Social-primary madman or Physical-primary maniac hiding among the ranks). Talents and Knowledges are likely most popular among Malkavians. Backgrounds tend to be either broad and shallow or few and deep, representing the way the way the Malkavian caroms through unlife. Virtues, Humanity, and Paths often tumble quickly, usually in the wake of Willpower doing the same.<\/p><p><b>Clan Disciplines:<\/b> Auspex, Dementation, Obfuscate<\/p><p><b>Weaknesses:<\/b> All members of Clan Malkavian suffer from a permanent, incurable derangement.

Some say the Lunatics all share a hive consciousness; others claim that this is in fact the lingering consciousness of the Clan\u2019s progenitor Malkav. Still others claim that a network of madness puts all Malkavians in contact with one another and is the cause of their crippling insanity. If nothing else, the Malkavians prove inscrutable and uncanny. One night, each of them frenzies when they see one another, while the next night, they all converge at the same time at the Sheriff\u2019s haven and accuse him of harboring Sabbat spies.

They are the thief in the night, the <i>raksha<\/i> chased by the wind, the nightmare-dream too fearful to be real. Whether associated with the Romani folk of Europe or the grave-robbing gh\u00fbl of Western Asia, Kindred society burdens the Ravnos with prejudices of foulness, uncleanliness, and wickedness.<\/p><p>With reputations like these, the Ravnos are considered outsiders even among those Kindred who do not ally themselves with Sects. Many young Ravnos tend toward nomadic unlives, moving from one domain to the next or hiding on the fringes of established territories where they can escape if local Kindred sentiment turns against them. This exacerbates their reputations as transients, gypsies, and vagrant scourges, but Ravnos vampires adapt well, thriving in their marginalized role. In fact, many choose to make themselves into the ravening terrors that other Kindred believe them to be.<\/p><p>The more enlightened among the Ravnos follow a Clan ideology inspired by the cycle of reincarnation espoused by many Indian faiths. Among some young and unprincipled members of the Clan, however, this philosophy becomes a penchant for capriciousness or an excuse for chaos. It is these latter Kindred who give so many Ravnos a bad name, but even the devout seem bizarre to many vampires.<\/p><p>The Ravnos practice a unique Discipline known as Chimerstry that convinces their enemies that they see things that do not exist. Chimerstry does much to convince Kindred that the Ravnos trade in lies and misdirection, but it can also prove to be a Deceiver\u2019s salvation and ease the vagaries of an outcast unlife.<\/p><p><b>Nickname:<\/b> Deceivers<\/p><p><b>Sect:<\/b> Clan Ravnos often has a difficult time heeding the rigorous order of many Camarilla cities, and has no inherent love for the violence of the Sabbat.

What few elders of the Clan may remain are presumed to come from Indian or Middle Eastern origins. Given that the Clan is widely spread and holds no traditional central domain, no consistent look can be said to be predominant, and any mendicant Kindred might be of Ravnos origin.<\/p><p><b>Haven:<\/b> Many Ravnos take to the road instead of establishing permanent havens, dwelling temporarily among itinerant communities, at roadside rest stops, or even in vehicles. When a Deceiver does put down roots in a domain, his permanent haven is often away from high-profile Kindred territories. Havens in ethnic ghettos, industrial outskirts, and isolated geography are safest and most easily cultivated for the Ravnos.<\/p><p><b>Background:<\/b> The Ravnos are scattered and suspicious, and those childer who don\u2019t have the tendency toward self-sufficiency don\u2019t last long. In many cases, a Ravnos will either never sire, or sire for companionship or safety, with little concern for how well a childe will fare as a vampire. Ravnos rarely seek out childer actively, instead drawing from those whose paths they cross on any given night. As such, the hard-luck drifter reputation tends to follow the Deceivers.<\/p><p><b>Character Creation:<\/b> Outsider and selfish Natures are common among the Clan. Physical and Social Attributes predominate, as do Talents and Skills. Savvy Ravnos develop a breadth of Backgrounds that can give them an edge when they\u2019re on the move or in a tight spot, such as stashed Resources, defensible Domain, and a few Allies or Contacts.<\/p><p><b>Clan Disciplines:<\/b> Animalism, Chimerstry, Fortitude<\/p><p><b>Weaknesses:<\/b> A turbulent history makes the Ravnos slaves to their vices.

That said, Ravnos often like to make a great show of Clan camaraderie and cultural ritual, even though they know that promises made to one another are as fleeting as whispers on a night wind.

These Kindred are the Toreador, and they spend unlives ensconced in pleasure.<\/p><p>Of course, for vampires of this disposition, it\u2019s easy to become jaded and bitter. More than the other Clans, Toreador often succumb to ennui, or fight the eventual boredom of unchanging immortality by playing at rivalries. An excess of stimulation turns them into slaves to the sensations they seek. The most debased Toreador can become true monsters, sinking to unimaginable levels of depravity in order to feel anything at all.<\/p><p>The Kindred of Clan Toreador often involve themselves greatly in the world of mortals. They have any number of reasons, whether enjoying proximity to the blush of life, cultivating veritable cults of doting followers, or influencing and following the trends that their own kind simultaneously mock and venerate. To hear the Toreador tell it, they are the Muses of a desperate mortal world, inspiring through their beauty or patronage.<\/p><p>Toreador culture is a mixture of sybarites, dilettantes, and visionaries. Some Toreador, with echoes of mortal passion, Embrace lovers or \u201cproject\u201d progeny who seem to fly in the face of every Toreador custom. These either don\u2019t last long or rise to great prominence as subversives and individualists. Ideas, trends, and \u201cthe next great thing\u201d spread through the Clan, and other Kindred often look to the Toreador to guide them.

Indeed, those gifted with less physical beauty often go that much further with their choice of accoutrements.<\/p><p><b>Haven:<\/b> The Degenerates spare no expense in appointing their havens in luxury, often with many original works of art. It is a point of pride among Toreador to have an unconventional (and thus memorable) haven with modern comforts; thus, many have striking lofts and penthouses, while the bolder among them renovate or repurpose everything from abandoned aquariums or deconsecrated churches to rooftop gardens or converted warehouse-galleries in fashion-forward neighborhoods.

Toreador also love to cultivate Backgrounds. Allies, Contacts, Resources, Domain, Haven, Mentors, Resources, Retainers \u2014 all of these have great value among Toreador.

Those early Tremere then made a bargain \u2014 or wrought a spell, or any number of other harrowing methods attributed to the Clan \u2014 that changed them from what they had been into the vampires they are tonight. Some claim they stole the Curse of Caine from a torpid Antediluvian, or that they concocted the flawed immortality of the Kindred from the stolen vitae of other vampires. Such mysterious origins, which some describe as treacherous or even blasphemous, haunt the Tremere, as the other Clans look upon them with mistrust and suspicion. The history \u2014 and, indeed, the modern legacy \u2014 of the Tremere is one marked by Clan war, centuries-old grudges, and the stain of unwholesome mysteries long left unsolved.<\/p><p>Tonight, Clan Tremere is a Clan shaped by its practice of blood sorcery. A flexible Discipline, Thaumaturgy is heavily entrenched within the Tremere, and they maintain cultic havens known as chantries to study its uses and share secrets among each other. To the Tremere, blood is both sustenance and the source of mystical power; they gather in their witch-houses to further their understanding of the vitae that is such a focal point of their unlives.<\/p><p>Beyond the practice of Thaumaturgy itself, the Warlocks are known for their close-knit hierarchy. They hail from the Old World, with an established power base in Vienna to which all members of the Clan answer to some degree. Although they may be one of the youngest Clans \u2014 in the terms with which deathless creatures like vampires measure time \u2014 they are as adept at the Jyhad as any Kindred. Beset by enemies who call them usurpers and backed by allies who may or may not defend the alliances they force, the Tremere have evolved to be self-sufficient. Indeed, many who eye them warily think they possess too great an edge, with their flexible Discipline and protective Clan and chantry structure, and move against them both secretly and overtly.<\/p><p><b>Nickname:<\/b> Warlocks<\/p><p><b>Sect:<\/b> Clan Tremere considers itself one of the pillars of the Camarilla. It is rumored that they once performed a ritual that all but eradicated those of the Clan not loyal to the Ivory Tower (and thus the Tremere\u2019s pyramidal hierarchy).<\/p><p><b>Appearance:<\/b> Tremere often have two distinct presentations: a traditional and severe public aspect and a much more eldritch mien better suited to wielding their blood sorceries. When out in public or at Kindred events, the Tremere favor conservative suits and dresses and muted tones. When in their chantries or convening with others of their Clan, they often prefer robes decorated with subtle occult symbols or garb with various folds and pockets for their bizarre ritual ingredients.<\/p><p><b>Haven:<\/b> Many Tremere rely on a central chantry the Clan maintains in cities where it has a notable presence. More solitary Warlocks develop private havens, with all of the trappings one might expect from an occult scholar, from libraries to alchemical laboratories to moonlit balcony observatories and even more sinister oubliettes where vivisected \u201cresearch subjects\u201d bleed according to experimental Tremere-controlled stimuli.<\/p><p><b>Background:<\/b> The Tremere draw from a fairly narrow pool of potential acolytes. Those who have an awareness of the supernatural, who are driven to succeed, who seek answers that elude less inquisitive individuals, yet who also have the discipline to heed the edicts of the hierarchy make good Tremere. This isn\u2019t to say that individualists don\u2019t have room in the Clan; rather, those who go their own way may well find themselves leading a chantry \u2014 or greeting the sun if their interests don\u2019t align with those of the pyramid.<\/p><p><b>Character Creation:<\/b> Mental Attributes and Knowledges are prominent among the Tremere. Many have high Courage and Willpower, but are somewhat lacking in Conscience or Conviction. They often favor Backgrounds that heighten their relationship to the Clan, like Mentor, Status, and Retainers (whom an accomplished Warlock may craft from otherwise inert components).<\/p><p><b>Clan Disciplines:<\/b> Auspex, Dominate, Thaumaturgy<\/p><p><b>Weaknesses:<\/b> Tremere dependency on blood is even more pronounced than that of other Kindred.

The Tzimisce call these lands their ancestral home. Since time out of mind the Fiends have been masters and lords of the domains of much of Eastern Europe. But theirs is a proud, selfish Clan for which tradition goes only so far despite their aristocratic origins. In fact, the Clan claims to have destroyed its Antediluvian, and in the wake of that momentous event, helped establish the foundations of the Sabbat.<\/p><p>Tzimisce practice a strange Discipline known as Vicissitude that allows them to twist the skin and bone of their victims. In many cases, they refine their fleshly arts by practicing upon themselves, but they just as frequently use it upon their lackeys and retainers, turning their boyars and <i>szlachta<\/i> into monstrous thralls. Vicissitude itself is a much misunderstood Discipline, and debates over its origins occasionally plunge the Clan into vicious partisan rivalries.<\/p><p>Clan Tzimisce is a Clan of extremes, and long, cold nights spent in remote castles have turned the Fiends\u2019 perspectives both greatly inward and outward. Mystics of the Clan study a philosophy of metamorphosis, seeking to discover what lies beyond the state of vampirism. An alien attitude of spiritual secularism characterizes many Tzimisce. Young members of the Clan often find themselves detached from the historical role of the Fiends as terrifying landed lords, and throw themselves wholly into a cause of their own choice, whether as Sabbat zealots, fleshcrafted horrors, or transcendental <i>koldun<\/i> sorcerers.<\/p><p><b>Nickname:<\/b> Fiends<\/p><p><b>Sect:<\/b> The Tzimisce are longtime but largely detached members of the Sabbat. They were instrumental in the Sect\u2019s nascence, and remain one of its most numerous Clans.<\/p><p><b>Appearance:<\/b> Given their ability to manipulate their physical appearance with Vicissitude, Tzimisce look however they want, and they often want to provoke or frighten. Some prefer extreme modifications and experimentations with their bodies that leave them looking only vaguely humanoid. Others seek to redefine and even transcend the limits of their forms, rebuilding themselves in the images of angels, monsters, nightmares, and things even less recognizable.<\/p><p><b>Haven:<\/b> Young Tzimisce are often Sabbat Priests or Ducti, and prefer to maintain communal havens with their packs. They encourage the pack to live in fearsome locations, such as beneath a hospital or morgue, or in the dank recesses of a mausoleum. Elders of the Clan sometimes have ancestral holdings in the Old World, and the image of the vampire on the craggy mountain in a crumbling castle owes much to Tzimisce lords. Rarely are these ancient holdings kept to any modern standards of comfort, but their lords are strangely hospitable to invited guests (and terribly intolerant of uninvited bores).<\/p><p><b>Background:<\/b> Elder Tzimisce, particularly those of the still-landed nobility in hoary old domains, may have family lines from which they Embrace, or they may restrict their occasional siring to the terrified villages suffering in thrall beneath their estates. New World and younger Tzimisce aren\u2019t as discriminating and are more practical. Indeed, many Tzimisce fledglings are little more than shock troops, Embraced and warped to the limits of their frames to cause revulsion and revel in bloodshed until put down.<\/p><p><b>Character Creation:<\/b> Few Tzimisce know moderation, and thus often favor Physical or Mental Attributes, usually with one extraordinarily high Trait. Knowledges are usually favored, though Skills are valued as well. Mentor, Allies, Domain, and Retainers are all quite appropriate to Tzimisce, as are narrow \u2014 almost overdeveloped \u2014 Disciplines. Their alien mindsets often lead them to follow Paths of Enlightenment.

As such, Tzimisce organization, such as it is, has a high regard for solitude. It is against their nature to be inclusive, and thus they have to work at being Sabbat (though this is less difficult for younger Tzimisce of at least somewhat modern outlooks).

Theirs is a legacy of rulership, from Ventrue fledglings starting their climb to the top to the mightiest elders whose influence spans the world. Long have they played kingmaker in the shadows in the mortal world, and long have they been the Clan of Kings among the Kindred.<\/p><p>Other Clans, of course, find all this insufferably pompous at best, punishably tedious at worst. Someone has to lead, surely, but why does it always have to be some long-winded, self-aggrandizing Ventrue? The Blue Bloods try to bear the criticism of their lessers with a sense of noblesse oblige \u2014 ever heavy hangs that head that wears the crown \u2014 but even the most munificent of Kindred leaders occasionally succumbs to tyranny and bloody rage.<\/p><p>Tonight, the Ventrue are a synthesis of the modern and the ancient, often in stark contrast within the Clan and among one another. Theirs is money of old, from the vaults of Croesus, but their young manipulate stock markets and influence currencies. Elders may command armies or even whole governments, while neonates conjure their assets from a website or smartphone app. But for all their wealth, their distinguished history, and their status among the Damned, each and every Ventrue must still seek that one resource that makes Kindred society egalitarian: precious blood.<\/p><p><b>Nickname:<\/b> Blue Bloods<\/p><p><b>Sect:<\/b> To hear the Ventrue tell it, the very idea of the Camarilla originated with them. Every other Clan realized what an invaluable proposition it was and flocked to their banner.<\/p><p><b>Appearance:<\/b> The Ventrue favor conservative clothing and reserved presentation, unless they\u2019re making a point about power or money. Ventrue Princes may well wear a circlet or carry a scepter as symbols of office, while young Blue Bloods display their own achievement via suits, ties, dresses, and accessories that are easily overlooked singularly but add up to a stunning total effect. If a Ventrue has so much as a hair out of place, it\u2019s because he spent all night running down the Society of Leopold and demanding the Sabbat menace retreat.<\/p><p><b>Haven:<\/b> A Ventrue\u2019s haven displays both her great power (read: wealth) and distinguished tastes. Opulent, grandiose, even baroque \u2014 these may all apply to Ventrue havens. They shun the gaudy displays of other Kindred, and their style tends less to the avant-garde than it does to the classical and traditional. To the Blue Bloods,  a well-maintained haven is an extension of oneself, and for someone to see it in less than flawless state implies weakness, distraction, or even madness.<\/p><p><b>Background:<\/b> Anyone who has \u201cmade something of herself\u201d may attract the attention of the Ventrue, who judge their childer based on their prominence and success even before they start to groom them for the Embrace. Socialites, moneyed family, corporate wunderkinds, military leaders, and even untested newcomers who show great promise are keenly valued among the Blue Bloods.<\/p><p><b>Character Creation:<\/b> Ventrue usually have directorial or outgoing personality archetypes. Members of Clan Ventrue favor Social and Mental Attributes, but any Ability category can be primary, reflecting a personal avenue of expertise. Backgrounds go both wide and deep for the Ventrue, with almost every Blue Blood possessing some amount of Resources, Status, and Herd (particularly the latter, given the Clan weakness). Elders in particular cultivate enviable havens and sprawling Domains.<\/p><p><b>Clan Disciplines:<\/b> Dominate, Fortitude, Presence<\/p><p><b>Weaknesses:<\/b> The Ventrue have rarified tastes, and they find only one specific type of mortal blood palatable and vital for them.

Vampiric blood is exempt from this restriction.<\/p><p><b>Organization:<\/b> The Clan-wide organization of the Ventrue is localized and feudal, with various universally understood peerages, vassalages, oaths of fealty, and sworn boons taking the place of a rigid hierarchy. Many Ventrue style themselves as secret masters of their domains, consolidating power in longstanding networks and forming conspiracies. The Ventrue greatly value propriety and honor, and use many forms of address and respect \u2014 their Laws of Decorum are complex and rigid, and could fill several volumes.

He took the name Baal-the-Destroyer, and he led his apostles against the Second City. The battle was terrible, and none caught in its wake were spared \u2014 Demon and Kindred alike perished. But the Baali and their unholy allies were routed and fled, and over the millennia, they faded from memory, to legend, to cautionary tale.<\/p><p>The Baali do still exist, though. The Inquisition weeded out the stupid and the careless, but left the clever and the patient. Some went into torpor, while others simply claimed membership in another Clan and begged for sanctuary. Now, in modern nights, the bloodline sees more concentrated activity than it has for centuries. Baali are explorers and seekers of secrets. They will do almost anything and sacrifice almost anyone to gain access to occult mysteries. They squander the wealth they have accumulated, they make deals they cannot possible hope to live up to, and they do so with no apology and no attempt at excuse. They seem to know that they are in decline, and that their bloodline is disappearing into the mists of time.<\/p><p>The bloodline has enemies, after all. Infernalists \u2014 those who call up and worship demons \u2014 are one of the very few beings that can be called \u201ccommon enemies\u201d by most of the denizens of the World of Darkness, Kindred and otherwise.<\/p><p>Despite their small numbers and host of enemies, the Baali are dangerous. They are not Faustian bargainers, looking for comfort or even knowledge. They do not wish to reign in Hell. They believe \u2014 they know \u2014 that the world is doomed. The End Times are here, and every sacrifice they make, every murder they incite, is one more chink in the dam holding back the deluge of blood called Gehenna. If they have to die to break that dam, so be it.

No matter where the Baali make their havens, though, the vampire\u2019s very presence changes the place. Vermin creep in first, and no amount of effort can keep them out.<\/p><p><b>Background:<\/b> The Baali value temperament above profession. Teachers, defrocked priests, laborers, artists \u2014 all have joined the ranks of the Baali. The bloodline even breeds their own recruits, drawing from ghoul families raised over the years to produce offspring suckled on the unholy truths that the Baali recite as gospel.<\/p><p><b>Character Creation:<\/b> Mental Attributes, especially Perception, are usually primary. A Baali\u2019s ability to tempt and entice depend on his insight into what a person truly wants.

Blood Brothers do not continually suffer these penalties unless one of them suffers a new wound.","Descr":"<p>The Blood Brothers are Kindred only in a very loose sense. They are Sabbat shock troops, created by Tremere and Tzimisce sorcerers in order for the Sword of Caine to have loyal soldiers that can still pass for human. The process of creation (for the Blood Brothers do not undergo an Embrace) washes away any individuality and personality, leaving only strong, savage, and near-mindless quasi-vampires.<\/p><p>Blood Brothers are usually created in small groups of three to 10. These groups \u2014 called \u201ccircles\u201d \u2014 become family units connected by a kind of hive mind. The Sabbat also usually arranges for a Tzimisce to fleshcraft the circle\u2019s faces so that they are identical.<\/p><p>The Frankensteins are a secret weapon for the Sabbat for several reasons. The Sabbat finds that while the loyalty of the Blood Brothers is beyond reproach, they don\u2019t possess much in the way of creativity. They aren\u2019t capable of trickery, clever tactics, or improvisation, and unless another vampire can direct them in the field in real time (which isn\u2019t impossible, given modern communication technology), they aren\u2019t good for much beyond simple, direct missions. Second, they are difficult and risky to create. Creating a circle of Blood Brothers means killing half a dozen people. While the Sabbat doesn\u2019t have a problem with that in itself, a pattern of disappearances can clue in mortal authorities and Camarilla watchers alike that the Sword of Caine is up to something.<\/p><p>Finally, the Blood Brothers are more useful as a surprise attack, and survivors of those attacks run the risk of passing along knowledge of the Brothers\u2019 weaknesses. Creating too many, even if it were possible or practical, would mean that eventually some Camarilla Tremere would figure out how to hurt them, or even how to reverse the magic that keeps them mindless, loyal, and useful. Some rumors say that this has already happened, but that the Tremere aren\u2019t willing to share this knowledge with the Camarilla just yet.<\/p><p><b>Nickname:<\/b> Frankensteins<\/p><p><b>Sect:<\/b> The Blood Brothers belong to the Sabbat exclusively.

As long as the circle is allowed to stay together, they don\u2019t seem to care much about amenities.<\/p><p><b>Background:<\/b> A Blood Brother\u2019s mortal life is irrelevant. All that a person needs to do to become a Blood Brother is cross the wrong vampire\u2019s path on the wrong night. The Sabbat kills the target, removes his body hair, smooths over his features, and places him with four or five others, and after that no trace of the man-that-was remains.<\/p><p><b>Character Creation:<\/b> Blood Brothers prioritize Physical Attributes and Talents.

Kindred scholars believe that the Daughters sprang from the blood of either Clan Toreador (for their passionate artistic pursuit) or Malkavian (given their propensity for causing madness), but their supernatural powers point more toward Clan Ventrue. It\u2019s something of a moot point, as the \u201cfirst\u201d Daughter of Cacophony is unknown. Regardless of their origins, the Sirens (as they are called in Kindred circles) are all singers, and the bloodline has always been predominantly female.<\/p><p>Indeed, the Daughters of Cacophony base their unlives on song. They wander through eternity with music always in their ears, and that makes them seem unfocused or flighty to other Kindred. This is one of the reasons, along with their rarity, that neither major Sect of vampires considers them a threat or much more than a diversion.

Why the Gargoyles choose to ally themselves with the Sect that also protects their former masters is anyone\u2019s guess. One of the going theories is that it\u2019s a slap in the Warlocks\u2019 collective face, but most Kindred don\u2019t give the Gargoyles credit for being that sophisticated. More likely, the Rockheads simply realize that in the Camarilla, their talents will be recognized and no one will try and order them around (at least not directly).<\/p><p>Gargoyles are created out of other Kindred, and this ugly fact makes their creation a seldom-discussed topic in polite vampiric society. The Tremere start with a Gangrel, Nosferatu, or Tzimisce vampire and perform obscene, bloody rituals using its blood, heart, and skin. Vitae from another vampire (from one of the other two Clans) is used to provoke a violent mutation, with the result that some Gargoyles look purely hideous (Nosferatu base), some look feral (Gangrel base), and some look fleshy and sport bony protrusions (Tzimisce base).

Other common nicknames are Rockheads, Runaways, Freemen, and Grotesques.<\/p><p><b>Sect:<\/b> Gargoyles usually join the Camarilla. It\u2019s not impossible for a Slave to join the Sabbat, but the bloodline as a whole frowns on this.<\/p><p><b>Appearance:<\/b> Not all Gargoyles look like the stone grotesques found spitting rainwater over old buildings, but all are nightmarish. Some have tufts of hair protruding randomly over their bodies, or odd, galloping walks. Most Gargoyles have gray, rock-like skin. All Gargoyles have wings. These grow as the character\u2019s Flight (see p. 447) increases.<\/p><p><b>Haven:<\/b> Slave Gargoyles sleep wherever their masters allow them \u2014 closets, basements, crypts, cells. Free Gargoyles prefer sleeping in havens high above the ground. Bell towers and disused high-rises are favorites. Gargoyles are often muscle for other Kindred, sometimes in exchange for a bare-bones haven.<\/p><p><b>Background:<\/b> Gargoyles creation rarely shows a discernible pattern. The Change tortures the new Gargoyle\u2019s body, as bones elongate and split to form the wings. The face warps, leaving nothing to recognize the mortal or vampire by. They rarely remember their unlife or mortal existence.<\/p><p><b>Character Creation:<\/b> Created to be slaves, Gargoyles specialize in Physical Attributes, Talents, and a few select Skills (Melee, for instance). All Gargoyles start with a free dot of the Flight Discipline. Appearance is always zero. Gargoyles created by the Tremere are at the same Generation as the Kindred that act as their \u201cbase.\u201d<\/p><p><b>Clan Disciplines:<\/b> Flight, Fortitude, Potence, Visceratika<\/p><p><b>Weakness:<\/b> The Slaves are hideous. That grotesquery takes different forms, but always results in an Appearance of zero. They are also highly susceptible to mind control from any source. A Gargoyle\u2019s Willpower score (current or permanent) is considered two points lower when used to resist such powers.<\/p><p><b>Organization:<\/b> Gargoyles have a strong sense of community. They often keep communal havens. Sometimes Gargoyles petition the Prince for the release of slave Gargoyles, but more often they just tear slave owners to pieces. With no community, Gargoyles arelikely to Embrace and build their own.<\/p><div class=ttlStereo><h3>Stereotypes<\/h3><p><b>Camarilla:<\/b> <i>Our new home.

The Harbingers are alleged to all be elders, and frighteningly powerful. While their sudden appearance suggests a long bout of torpor, they don\u2019t behave like recently-awakened vampires. Indeed, they claim they have been dead these past five centuries.<\/p><p>The Harbingers of Skulls resemble rotting corpses, much like the Samedi. Indeed, vampires that know of both bloodlines suggest a common origin, but since neither the Samedi nor the Harbingers discuss their origins publically, it\u2019s just speculation.<\/p><p>The Harbingers have only been members of the Sabbat for a short time, but during that time they have made themselves invaluable. The Sword of Caine, lacking Giovanni members, has difficulty dealing with ghosts. This can lead to problematic hauntings, since the Sabbat kills enough people that ghostly visitation can become an issue. The Harbingers can exorcises these vengeful shades, or, better yet, turn them into incorporeal spies and slaves. And for all of this, the Harbingers ask nothing except for favors to be repaid at a later date.<\/p><p>The Sabbat, for its part, isn\u2019t usually given to the favor-trading that one finds in the Camarilla, but what the Harbingers bring to the table is too valuable to miss. And besides, whether one believes the fairy tale about noble origins and \u201crevenge on the traitorous moneylenders\u201d that the Harbingers sometimes spin, their passion is palpable. That kind of murderous zeal is always welcome in the Sword of Caine.<\/p><p><b>Nickname:<\/b> Lazarenes<\/p><p><b>Sect:<\/b> The Harbingers of Skulls belong entirely to the Sabbat. That said, given that the bloodline obviously has many secrets buried, it\u2019s impossible to know if any Lazarenes claim membership in the Camarilla or remain independent.<\/p><p><b>Appearance:<\/b> The Harbingers prefer to stay hidden in their havens, or at least remain among Kindred, and for good reason. They resemble emaciated, shrunken corpses. Their skin grows taut and white, and the gums recede, giving the impression of a bleached, grinning skull. Most Harbingers wearing flowing garments or burial shrouds, the better to highlight their affinity for death.<\/p><p><b>Haven:<\/b> Unlike most Sabbat Kindred, the Harbingers of Skulls do not join packs, and therefore do not use communal havens. They usually choose lairs away from mortal interference, but close enough to the living that they don\u2019t want for blood (or fresh corpses for their horrific arts). Crypts, disused laboratories, and slaughterhouses are common choices.<\/p><p><b>Background:<\/b> The background of a \u201ctypical\u201d Harbinger is impossible to know. They are all elders, and who they were in life has been lost to time. They do seem to show evidence of a classical education, and one survivor of a battle between a Harbinger and a gang of Camarilla Brujah mentions that the Lazarene used a style of fighting that originated in Florence. Beyond those sparse clues, however, the Harbingers\u2019 true identities are unknown.<\/p><p><b>Character Creation:<\/b> The Harbingers of Skulls tend toward morbid and somewhat violent concepts. They are obsessed with revenge, death, and the horrors beyond the grave. Social Attributes and Abilities aren\u2019t a priority. Mental Attributes and Knowledges are generally highly rated, but their status as elders means that they are formidable across the board (and imply a significant amount spent on the Generation Background to boot).<\/p><p><b>Clan Disciplines:<\/b> Auspex, Fortitude, Necromancy<\/p><p><b>Weakness:<\/b> No matter how much blood a Harbinger consumes, her skin remains deathly pale.

Other Kindred, it seems, can\u2019t understand how a lineage of vampires that is so very strange could be nothing more than scholars. To hear the rumor-mill tell it, the Kiasyd can feed only on the blood of infants, or faeries, or unspoiled virgins.

Most of them are well over six feet tall (two meters or more), willowy, and thin. Their skin isn\u2019t just pale, as with most vampires, but glows faintly in moonlight. Their eyes are almond-shaped and have no visible pupils. They are often violet or jet black in color. Their ears are slightly pointed. The Kiasyd cover this with a hat or headband when going out amongst mortals, but even so, their height and skin tone make them stand out.<\/p><p><b>Haven:<\/b> Most Kiasyd spend years building up their havens, improving security, library facilities, and other amenities. They are fiercely protective of their homes, and they do not allow guests without explicit invitations. When they do invite guests, however, they treat them well, offering vintage vitae, comfortable rooms and, of course, plenty of reading material.<\/p><p><b>Background:<\/b> Museum curators, talented students, librarians, rare book experts, and academics of all stripes are likely choices for Kiasyd Embraces.

It was also said that he grew progressively more disgusted with Kindred affairs over time, and weary of the constant, bloody cycles of violence and betrayal. He left his home for lands far to the east. When he returned, he was changed. He was tranquil and contemplative, but also somewhat fatalistic. Most surprisingly, though, he had developed a third eye in his forehead. Saulot Embraced new childer, and his Clan slowly split into two distinct lines \u2014 the \u201cwarrior\u201d and \u201chealer\u201d Salubri.

They ask, quite reasonably, how the Salubri are able to achieve Golconda with any regularity. They wonder how any line can sustain itself with so few members. And, finally, they pose this question: even if these first two notions are taken as given, why would the Salubri need to submit to diablerie?

Brujah, it is said, was not the hot-blooded warrior\/scholar that many vampires associate with the Rabble, but rather a staid, passionless introvert. Why, then, he chose to Embrace a maniac like Troile in the first place is a mystery that will likely never be fully explained.<\/p><p>The True Brujah were never subject to a massive purge as the Salubri or the Cappadocians were, but they don\u2019t Embrace often and never recovered from the theft of their Clan status. Their city \u2014 the Carthage of Kindred myth, in which vampires openly ruled over mortals \u2014 supposedly died out due to the treachery of Troile\u2019s childer (though other stories suggest demonic influence). From there, the bloodline faded from history. A few notable members of the bloodline appear throughout history, but by the modern nights only Kindred historians or those who chance to meet them can speak of their existence.<\/p><p>Whatever the truth of their origins, the True Brujah have remained a small but constant presence in Kindred society. Sometimes they wear their true nature openly, while other times they claim membership in other Clans (stating their Clan as \u201cBrujah,\u201d for example, and not bothering to correct the misapprehension that ensues). Their primary focus is the pursuit of knowledge, and to that end they have made some strange alliances. The True Brujah occasionally ally with the Followers of Set, and sometimes even provide services as consultants to the Sabbat in exchange for access to secrets and locations normally closed to them.<\/p><p><b>Nickname:<\/b> Sages<\/p><p><b>Sect:<\/b> The Sages have become more or less independent. They follow the Camarilla\u2019s rules when in their cities, and avoid the Sabbat lest they become pressed into service or destroyed.

As the centuries wore on, though, the Sages Embraced progeny from across Europe and, eventually, the New World. In modern nights, True Brujah tend to dress professionally, the better to fit in with the academic settings they prefer.<\/p><p><b>Haven:<\/b> Some True Brujah maintain multiple havens around the world, which they use as they travel pursuing whatever kind of knowledge they find most fascinating. Others stay closer to a given city, generally with a centuries-old university or other center of learning nearby. In either case, their havens tend to be clean, well-maintained, and austere.<\/p><p><b>Background:<\/b> It\u2019s not entirely accurate to say that the True Brujah only Embrace academics and scholars, but it\u2019s fairly rare for them to do otherwise. Sages sometimes Embrace out of curiosity or even spite, but for the most part they choose people whose capacity of learning and accumulated knowledge will benefit their sires.<\/p><p><b>Character Creation:<\/b> Mental Attributes and Knowledges are usually primary. True Brujah sires instruct their childer in the basics of Occult and some form of combat (it\u2019s just not practical to be unable to fight).

Caught between two warring factions of Sabbat Gangrel, she watched as her packmates were pulled into the conflict and ultimately killed. She renounced the Sabbat and the Gangrel Clan entirely, now calling herself \u201can Ahrimane,\u201d and called upon shamanic magic to alter herself. How exactly this was accomplished is still a mystery. One theory is that Muricia was an anomaly even before she attempted her magical working, and had access to powers that other vampires didn\u2019t. Another (possibly more plausible) theory is that Muricia had help from mortal sorcerers who were hoping the effect would spread throughout the Kindred of the world, sterilizing them and preventing any new vampires from being created.<\/p><p>Regardless of the origin, Muricia found that she was not able to create childer or blood bonds. She did, however, retain the ability to turn other Kindred (at least other Gangrel) into whatever she had become. She kept the animalistic features that she can gained during her previous unlife, however, and it may have been her cat-like eyes that lent her bloodline its nickname.<\/p><p>Muricia extended the offer of \u201cbecoming Ahrimane\u201d to any female Gangrel who wished it. She made it quite clear she was not interested in performing the process on male Kindred, though the specific reasons for this remain unclear. A few Gangrel joined her, taking havens in the southern United States and avoid contacting with other Sabbat.<\/p><p>The Ahrimanes were never numerous, and although they remained nominally allied with the Sabbat, Muricia made it quite clear that they were to be left alone. This isolation may have doomed them, however. In the late 1990s, all contact with the Cats ceased. Investigators found, sometime later, that their havens were empty, and no one has heard from them since. Most Sabbat believe that the Ahrimanes were destroyed, but concede that it is possible that Muricia might have led her line on a spiritual pilgrimage somewhere out of the Kindred\u2019s reach.<\/p><p><b>Nickname:<\/b> Cats<\/p><p><b>Sect:<\/b> The Ahrimanes were an independent Sect, or more accurately, a group of independent individuals. They identified more with the Sabbat than the Camarilla, if only because they did not wish to answer to any elder (expect perhaps Muricia).<\/p><p><b>Appearance:<\/b> All Ahrimanes were female, and most were either of African American or Native American descent (Muricia, apparently, was not partial to Caucasian vampires). Most Ahrimanes never went anywhere unarmed, and dressed to fight. Many Ahrimanes had animal features left over from their time as Gangrel.<\/p><p><b>Haven:<\/b> Muricia was a vampire of some means, and she purchased houses on the outskirts of several cities in the American South (in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Georgia especially). New Ahrimanes could make their own arrangements or stay in one of these homes.<\/p><p><b>Background:<\/b> All Ahrimanes were Gangrel before their magical transformation. As such, their Backgrounds varied just as much as the Beasts\u2019. The sort of Gangrel who became an Ahrimane was female, usually non-white, and frustrated by the situation in her Sect or city.<\/p><p><b>Character Creation:<\/b> All Ahrimanes had at least three dots in Mentor, to represent Muricia\u2019s guidance. Combat Abilities and Physical Attributes were common, but this was as much from the Ahrimanes\u2019 Gangrel background as anything else.

The prospective Tartar had to be an impressive warrior, but tempered enough in nature to understand that only by protecting his tribe from outward supernatural threats could he keep it healthy enough to feed from. Once the decision was made, the prospective sire would wash the candidate in a river, a ritual funerary bathing in the Mongol tradition. He would then drain and Embrace the new vampire.<\/p><p>This kind of ritual and observance governed much of the Anda\u2019s existence. Long and lonely nights wandering the steppe, either with the Mongols or alone (and they did wander alone, sometimes even into Western Europe), the Anda\u2019s Beast was the only company. Small wonder that these Kindred viewed themselves as spiritual warriors, their brutal ethos the only bulwark against madness and depredation.<\/p><p>The Anda made war against a variety of foes. They would join their nomad tribes against whatever enemies they chose (as far as they could, since not all battles were fought at night). They also clashed with native Chinese shapeshifters and vampires, and it was this latter group that proved the undoing of the Anda in the 14th century.

Nothing lasts forever in vampiric circles, but nothing ever truly dies.<\/p><p>The Cappadocians were a Clan that focused on death and undeath. Their founder, an ancient known simply as \u201cCappadocius\u201d (\u201cof Cappadocia\u201d), did not attempt to rule his Clan. He asked only that they continue the search for truth and the secrets of life and death. The Clan\u2019s ancestral roots were rumored to be somewhere in Asia Minor, but by the end of the Dark Ages they had spread throughout Europe. Known as scholars, mystics, and necromancers, the Cappadocians were as firmly entrenched in the Cainite society of their time as any of the Clans of the Camarilla are tonight.<\/p><p>The Graverobbers expanded their knowledge base by Embracing members of important families or promising scholars.

They accepted a Venetian merchant family called the Giovanni (the family\u2019s propensity for summoning up and controlling ghosts had as much to do with their Embrace as their skill with finance). Over the following centuries, the Giovanni worked their way into the hierarchy of the Clan, until Augustus Giovanni committed diablerie upon Cappadocius.

The Cappadocians acting as scholars or advisors enjoyed a better standard of unlife, but even they often chose places that mortals had no interest in exploring.<\/p><p><b>Background:<\/b> As a general rule, the Cappadocians were not concerned with ethnicity or nationality when Embracing, meaning that it wasn\u2019t uncommon to find Moors, Jews, or even pagans brought into the Clan.

Osiris, however, was horrified by his new condition. Rather than meet the sun, though, he became determined to face and banish his personal demons, and especially his own Beast.

The founder of the bloodline, Lamia, claimed to be a daughter of Lilith, Adam\u2019s first wife. According to legend, a Cappadocian elder named Lazarus found her performing sacred rites to Lilith, the Dark Mother. Impressed by her skill and perhaps taken with her fierce beauty, he Embraced her. While she died and the Change took her, Lilith gave her a vision, a deep understanding of her future and that of the Cappadocians. When she recovered, she whispered something to Lazarus, and the Cappadocian elder fled in terror.<\/p><p>Lamia did find her way back to the Clan, though, and her bloodline became the guardians of the Cappadocians. They were never very numerous, but important Graverobbers often had at least one Gorgon standing at their side. The Lamia learned to feed sparingly, since their bite carried disease, and developed their own path of Necromancy based on the four humors. Over the centuries, they became an important resource for the Cappadocians. And yet, behind their loyalty was perhaps a greater dedication to the Dark Mother and to the vision of their founder.<\/p><p>The Revelation of the Dark Mother seems to have led the line to tragedy, however. The Lamia died defending the Cappadocians when the Giovanni subsumed the Clan. Augustus Giovanni murdered Lamia herself following his diablerie of Cappadocius, and the last known member of the bloodline was destroyed in 1718 as part of a Camarilla blood hunt.<\/p><p><b>Nickname:<\/b> Gorgons<\/p><p><b>Sect:<\/b> The Lamia were somewhere between the High and Low Clans. They were not a Clan, but were considered part of Clan Cappadocian in most Cainites\u2019 understanding. Other Cainites, however, treated them respectfully as servants or soldiers, both out of deference to their skills and to their patrons.<\/p><p><b>Appearance:<\/b> The Lamia did not share the Cappadocians\u2019 pallor. Many of them were of Mediterranean or Semitic descent, though as the Cappadocians traveled across Europe with their Gorgon bodyguards, other nationalities came into the bloodline as well. The bloodline was predominantly female, but it wasn\u2019t uncommon for Lamia to dress as men (usually armed and armored).<\/p><p><b>Haven:<\/b> The Lamia shared havens with their Cappadocian patrons. When they made their own, they often chose crypts and sarcophagi, preferring to be alone among the dead (feeding on the recently dead also minimized their chance of starting an outbreak of plague).<\/p><p><b>Background:<\/b> Since the Lamia Embraced women almost exclusively, they seldom had the chance to Embrace trained warriors. Instead, the Gorgons often chose women who had some experience with death. Women who had attempted or contemplated suicide, or had recently committed murder, were common choices. Likewise, women with a pronounced interest in black magic or scholarly pursuits in general were candidates for the Lamia Embrace. Training in combat could come after the gift of immortality.<\/p><p><b>Character Creation:<\/b> All Lamia had some combat training, usually from their sires. Physical or Mental Attributes might be primary, as were Skills. The Lamia also tended to have some familiarity with Occult, both from the rites taught to them by their own bloodline and simply by proximity to the Cappadocians.<\/p><p><b>Clan Disciplines:<\/b> Fortitude, Necromancy, Potence<\/p><p><b>Weakness:<\/b> The Lamia carried the \u201cSeed of Lilith,\u201d a wasting disease spread by their bite.

They claimed that their founder \u2014 a vampire simply known as the Crone \u2014 became bonded with a spirit of the forests. This spirit was a desperate, jealous being that could apparently see that people would destroy the forests and burn the trees that comprised them. Joining with an undying predator, then, was apparently the spirit\u2019s attempt at dodging this fate. Whether or not any of that is true, the Lhiannan did have a connection to the natural world that no other vampire, not even the Gangrel, can equal.<\/p><p>Whenever a Lhiannan Embraced, a shard of that original spirit broke off and empowered the new Cainite. This spirit-shard allowed Lhiannan to use their Ogham Discipline, which, in turn, enabled the style of unlife that the Lhiannan enjoyed. It also made the Lhiannan territorial above all else, and the Druids were quite limited in their mobility. The Lhiannan, much like the Telyavelic Tremere (see p. 438) found common cause with the pagan peoples of Europe. This, unfortunately, put them into conflict with Cainites and mortals who followed the Christian faith.<\/p><p>The bloodline was never numerous (especially since creating a new Lhiannan meant that the sire grew weaker), but the fires of the Inquisition and the spread of the Christian religion took a harsh toll on the Druids. By the end of the 14th century, they had all been destroyed. In modern times, though, Gangrel trade rumors of powerful Kindred in European forests decorated with strange, bloody symbols, so perhaps some of them survived \u2014 or perhaps the forest spirit that initially created the bloodline has resurfaced.<\/p><p><b>Nickname:<\/b> Druids<\/p><p><b>Sect:<\/b> The Lhiannan did not survive to see the dawning of the Sabbat or the Camarilla. In historical nomenclature, they were decidedly on the Low Clan side of the social divide, and most Cainites probably wouldn\u2019t have known them from the Gangrel. Lhiannan rarely joined coteries, limited as they were in mobility.<\/p><p><b>Appearance:<\/b> The Druids resembled the native people of the regions of Europe that they called home \u2014 the British Isles, for the most part.<\/p><p><b>Haven:<\/b> The Lhiannan made their havens in the forests of Europe, constructing simple dwellings or finding natural shelter. They would sometimes find a man-made haven and kill or enslave the inhabitants, or very rarely eke out an existence on the periphery of human civilization by taking the role of a shaman or wise woman.<\/p><p><b>Background:<\/b> Since performing the Embrace meant growing weaker, the Druids only created childer out of sheer loneliness or when they found someone who truly impressed them. A pagan spirit-speaker with real devotion to her craft, or a woodsman with impeccable respect for the forests might be enough to get a Lhiannan\u2019s attention. The Lhiannan refused to Embrace Christians, Jews, or Muslims.<\/p><p><b>Character Creation:<\/b> All Lhiannan were capable of surviving in the wilderness, and so Physical Attributes, Skills, and Talents were important. A Lhiannan acting as a counsel to a mortal settlement was likely to have higher Social Attributes and appropriate Abilities. Herd and Retainers (animals) were common Backgrounds.<\/p><p><b>Clan Disciplines:<\/b> Animalism, Ogham, Presence<\/p><p><b>Weakness:<\/b> The Lhiannan were part nature spirit, and the mark of their inhumanity ran strong within them.

Once she re-entered her territory, her dice pools returned to normal within a few hours.<\/p><p><b>Organization:<\/b> Once a Lhiannan Embraced a childe, she generally kept the new vampire around for a few years until that childe was ready to fend for himself (and the novelty of having someone else around wore off). The sire would then send the childe away to find his own haven and territory. The Lhiannan were generally aware of members of their bloodline whose territories were adjacent, but there was no system of communication in place.

The trek to the far reaches of the world, in a place inhospitable to man, beast, or vampire, with no reliable way to feed is enough to put even the most curious Cainite off the idea. And yet, a bloodline of vampires managed to dwell close enough to see these lights on a regular basis. This line \u2014 the Noiad \u2014 felt it was their sacred duty to witness the Northern Lights and interpret the will of the gods. Their mortal charges, a nomadic tribe called the Sam\u00ed, lived in fear and awe of their godlike protectors. The Noiad defended the Sam\u00ed from outside threats, both natural and supernatural, and acted as shamans and teachers for these wanderers. In return, the Sam\u00ed gave of their blood and kept the Noiad safe during the long months with no darkness.<\/p><p>Of course, the touch of the Kindred corrupts everything. The Noiad protected the Sam\u00ed from monsters from the wastes, and their blood allowed the mortals to survive times of famine, but the Wanderers also refused to allow their mortal herds to change or improve. Interlopers were turned aside or killed, regardless of their intentions. When it became clear that the march of Christianity (and Lasombra working within the Church) could not be stopped, the Noiad pushed the Sam\u00ed further north, away from the herds that would sustain them and away from the dawning of a new era. Whether the Noiad saw something in the Northern Lights that spurred them to this decision, or whether it was simply fear of change, is not important in the end.

Kolduns, then, are Tzimisce wizards who are in tune with the land around them to a frightening degree.<\/p><p>The kolduns aren\u2019t protectors of the land, though, at least not in the way that the phrase usually implies. They use the land, drinking in its energy and reshaping it into weapons. They protect the land because it is theirs, and therefore they display the same territorialism for which the Tzimisce in general are so widely known.<\/p><p>For many years, Koldunic Sorcery was the province of a few very powerful elder Tzimisce, almost all Old Clan (see below). In recent nights, though, the knowledge of the magic has filtered down through the Clan\u2019s ranks, and even neonates may learn it. This is a huge departure from previous practices. It remains to be seen what effect Koldunic Sorcery will have on the world at large.<\/p><p><b>Nickname:<\/b> None<\/p><p><b>Disciplines:<\/b> The kolduns aren\u2019t truly a bloodline. Rather, koldunism is a practice within the Tzimisce where the vampire learns Koldunic Sorcery (at out-of-Clan costs). Koldun Clan Disciplines, therefore, are Auspex, Animalism, and either Dominate or Vicissitude (depending on whether the koldun is an Old Clan Tzimisce or not).<\/p><p><b>Weakness:<\/b> As with the rest of the Clan (p. 71): The koldun must rest in the proximity of at least two handfuls of native soil.

This penalty remains until they are able to rest for a full day in their earth.<\/p><p class=ttlQuote><b>Quote:<\/b> <i>I am the land. You have not violated my home...you have violated me.

They regard Vicissitude as a disease of the soul, and refuse to learn or employ it. In most other respects, though, they resemble the rest of the Clan. They share the Clan\u2019s propensity for manners and respect for territory, and as most of the surviving members of this \u201cbloodline\u201d still reside in what is now Romania, they govern their territories using Old World methods and customs. In some remote places, they rule more or less openly, taking blood tithe from the mortals under their \u201cprotection\u201d and keeping out other supernatural threats. As the world grows smaller through the use of information technology, though, those nights may be coming to an end.<\/p><p>The Old Clan would prefer never to have to deal with the \u201cdefiled\u201d members of Clan Tzimisce, but family is family and they can\u2019t survive the modern nights with no support. They make treaties and trade favors with other Fiends, sometimes lending support to the Sabbat as a whole in exchange for help and support when they need. One thing they refuse to do, though, is share blood with a Sabbat vampire. One never knows what might be swimming in it.<\/p><p><b>Nickname:<\/b> The Old Clan<\/p><p><b>Disciplines:<\/b> Animalism, Auspex, Dominate<\/p><p><b>Weakness:<\/b> As with the rest of the Clan (p. 71), the Old Clan Tzimisce must sleep in at least two handfuls of soil from their homeland.
