name: Chiropteran Marauder
---

Similar to Horrid Form, the Chiropteran Marauder is a terrifying, bipedal bat, bearing a wickedly fanged maw and veined, leathery wings. This power confers all of the benefits of the Horrid Form, in addition to a few others. The mere sight of the marauder is enough to make mortals or weak-willed vampires flee in horror.
_System_: The vampire gains all the effects of the Horrid Form. Further, the Marauder’s fluted wings allow flight at 25 mph (40 kph), during which the vampire may carry, but not manipulate, objects no larger than it can hold in its hands. If the player chooses to, she may make a ^Strength + Medicine^ roll (difficulty 6) to extend bony claws at the ends of the vampire’s wings. These claws inflict Strength + 2 aggravated damage. Also, the vampire subtracts two from all hearing-based Perception rolls (though he adds one to vision- based Wits and Perception rolls). Assuming the mantle of the Chiropteran Marauder costs three blood points.
