name: Unchain the Beast
---

The self-destructive nature of Cainites can be turned against them by an elder who possesses this formidable power. With a glance, the vampire can awaken the Beasts of her enemies, causing physical injury and excruciating agony as the victim’s own violent impulses manifest in physical form to tear him apart from within. A target of this power erupts into a fountain of blood and gore as claw and bite wounds from an invisible source spontaneously tear his flesh asunder.
_System_: The character makes eye contact (see p.152) with the intended victim. The player spends three blood points and rolls ^Manipulation + Intimidation^ (difficulty of the victim’s Self-Control/Instinct + 4). Each success inflicts one health level of aggravated damage, which can be soaked normally. A botch inflicts one health level of lethal damage to the invoking character for each “1” rolled. This damage can also be soaked normally.
