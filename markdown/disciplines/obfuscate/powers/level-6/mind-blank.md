name: Mind Blank

A vampire with this power is able to shrug off telepathic contact, easily withstanding invasive probes of her mind.
_System_: Any attempt to read or probe the character’s mind first requires a successful ^Perception + Empathy^ roll (difficulty equal to the character’s Wits + Stealth).
Even if a potential intruder does succeed, his dice pool for the attempt is then limited to the number of successes he scored on the initial roll.
