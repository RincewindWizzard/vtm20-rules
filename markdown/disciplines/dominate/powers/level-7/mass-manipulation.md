name: Mass Manipulation

A truly skilled elder may command small crowds through the use of this power. By manipulating the strongest minds within a given group, a gathering maybe directed to the vampireâ€™s will.
_System_: The player declares that he is using this power before rolling for the use of another Dominate power. The difficulty of the roll is that which would be required to Dominate the most resistant member of the target group - if he cannot be Dominated, no one in his immediate vicinity can. For every success past that needed to inflict the desired result on the first target, the player may choose one additional target to receive the same effect in its entirety. The vampire needs to make eye contact only with the initial target.
