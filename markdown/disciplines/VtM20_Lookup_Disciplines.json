Failure overwhelms the character\u2019s senses, making her oblivious to her surroundings for a turn or two. While the Malkavians and Toreador are more prone to these kinds of distractions, the Tremere and Tzimisce aren\u2019t immune.<\/p><p>Dots in Perception are very useful for using Auspex powers, as more successes help the character gain more sensory information.<\/p>"}, {"ID":"3","Name":"Celerity","IsSorc":"0","Descr":"<p>Not all vampires are slow, meticulous creatures.

The Assamites use their speed in conjunction with stealth to strike quickly and viciously from the shadows before they are noticed. Brujah, on the other hand, simply like the edge that the power gives them against overwhelming odds. The Toreador are more inclined to use Celerity to provide an air of unnatural grace to live performances or for an extra push to complete a masterpiece on time, but they can be as quick to draw blood as any assassin or punk when angered.<\/p><p><b>System:<\/b> Each point of Celerity adds one die to every Dexterity-related dice roll. In addition, the player can spend one blood point to take an extra action up to the number of dots he has in Celerity at the beginning of the relevant turn; this expenditure can go beyond her normal Generation maximum. Any dots used for extra actions, however, are no longer available for Dexterity-related rolls during that turn.

Rumors abound of Ravnos gh\u00fbls, rakshasas, and shapeshifters, but whatever its origins, Chimerstry remains a potent and powerful weapon for the Deceivers. The Discipline is, fundamentally, an art of conjuration that converts the vampire\u2019s will into phantoms that confound the senses and technology alike. Even vampires fall under the sway of the Ravnos\u2019 illusory world, unless they have a strong enough grasp of Auspex (see p. 142). The Ravnos often use this power to swindle and seduce their victims into acts that work out badly for the victim (but great for the Ravnos).<\/p><p>Illusions created by Chimerstry can be seen for what they are by a victim who \u201cproves\u201d the illusion\u2019s falsehood (e.g., a person who walks up to an illusory wall, expresses his disbelief in it, and puts his hand through it effectively banishes the illusion), and explicitly incredible illusions are seen as false immediately (e.g., dragons breathing fire or gravity working in reverse).

It is a vampire\u2019s ability to influence another person\u2019s thoughts and actions through her own force of will. Dominate requires that the vampire capture her victim\u2019s gaze (see p. 152); as such, it may be used against only one subject at a time. Further, commands must be issued verbally, although simple orders may be made with signs - for example, a pointed finger and forceful expression to indicate \u201cGo!\u201d However, the subject won\u2019t comply if he can\u2019t understand the vampire, no matter how powerful the Kindred\u2019s will is.<\/p><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, vampires to which Dominate comes naturally tend to be from willful, domineering Clans.

The persistence of such stories through the ages isn\u2019t surprising, since a number of Kindred Disciplines powers (most notably Dominate) require eye contact in order to work. Other vampires, learning of this requirement, have attempted everything from wearing mirrored sunglasses to gouging out their own eyes in order to prevent an elder from exerting his will upon them.<\/p><p.But Kindred are not so easily thwarted. The need for eye contact stems from the aggressor Kindred\u2019s need to see his victim\u2019s soul, and the eyes are the traditionally known as the windows to the soul. While the vampire needs to capture his target\u2019s attention, the target\u2019s eyes need not be present for such a power to work (although the arts of the Tzimisce make this somewhat challenging at times) - they only need to find the soul of his victim laid bare.<\/p><p>A target trying to avoid eye contact can make a Willpower roll against a difficulty equal to Dominate user\u2019s Manipulation + Intimidation (or other appropriate combination for other Disciplines or specific situations, at the Storyteller\u2019s discretion). The difficulty may be reduced for mitigating factors: -1 in the case of the target obscuring his eyes slightly (such as closing her eyes or wearing dark sunglasses) up to a -3 for the eyes being completely unseen (such as with a thick blindfold or having her eyes torn out). Ultimately, however, it is up to the Storyteller to decide whether eye contact is established in a particular case.<\/p>"}, {"ID":"7","Name":"Fortitude","IsSorc":"0","Descr":"<p>Although all vampires have an unnatural constitution that make them much sturdier than mortals, Fortitude bestows a resilience that would make an action movie hero envious.

It\u2019s similar to Thaumaturgy in that it has several \u201cpaths\u201d and accompanying \u201crituals\u201d rather than a strict linear progression of powers. The study of Necromancy is not widespread among the Kindred, and its practitioners - primarily the Giovanni - are shunned and despised for their foul practices (until those practices become useful, of course).<\/p><p>Over the centuries, the various schools of vampiric Necromancy have evolved and diversified from an earlier form of death magic, leaving several distinct paths of necromantic magic available to Cainites. Nearly all modern necromancers learn the Sepulchre Path first before extending their studies to other paths. The primary Necromancy path increases automatically as the character increases her overall Necromancy rating. Other paths must be bought separately, using the experience costs for secondary paths.<\/p><p>Like Thaumaturgy, Necromancy has also spawned a series of rituals. While not nearly so immediate in effect as the basic powers of Necromancy, Necromantic rituals can have impressive long-term effects. Unsurprisingly, the elements of Necromantic ritual are things like long-buried corpses and hands from the cadavers of hanged men, so obtaining suitable materials can be quite difficult.<\/p><p><b>System:<\/b> A Cainite necromancer must learn at least three levels in his primary path before learning his first level in a secondary Necromancy path. He must then master the primary path (all five levels) before acquiring any knowledge of a third path.<\/p><p>As with Thaumaturgy, advancement in the primary path costs the normal experience amount, while study of additional Necromantic paths incurs an additional experience-point cost (see p. 124). Because Necromancy is not quite so rigid a study as Thaumaturgy is, the rolls required to use Necromantic powers can vary from path to path and even within individual paths. The commonly-learned Sepulchre Path is presented first, with the remaining paths presented in alphabetical order.

An Obfuscated vampire doesn\u2019t actually become invisible, however - rather, he is able to delude observers into believing that he has vanished. Obfuscate also allows Kindred to change their features and conceal other people or objects. Typically vampires using Obfuscate must be within a short range of their witnesses (approximately five yards or meters per dot of Wits + Stealth) for their power to be effective.<\/p><p>Unless the Kindred chooses to make herself seen, she can remain obscured for as long as she wills it. At higher levels, the vampire can actually fade from sight so subtly that those nearby can\u2019t actually recall the moment at which she left.<\/p><p>Usually, few mortals or supernaturals (even those trained in Awareness) can pierce through the fog of Obfuscate. Animals, who rely more on their instincts than their normal senses, can sometime perceive (and be frightened by) the vampire\u2019s presence. Children and those to whom deception is foreign may also be able to pierce the illusion, at the Storyteller\u2019s discretion. Finally, the Auspex Discipline enables Kindred to see through Obfuscate. Even that is not guaranteed, however; refer to \u201cSeeing the Unseen,\u201d p. 142, for more details. (Storytellers needing a die roll for animals or children can use this quick and dirty guideline: treat them as if they had Auspex 1 in terms of contesting Obfuscate. They do not have the Auspex 1 power, but are considered to have it when determining whether a vampire is noticed.)<\/p><p>Since Obfuscate clouds the mind of the viewer, vampires can\u2019t use it to hide their presence from electronic or mechanical devices. Video and photo cameras, for example, capture the vampire\u2019s image accurately. Even so, the person using, say, her cell phone to record an Obfuscated vampire will still have her mind impacted by the power, and she won\u2019t see the Kindred\u2019s image until she views the video at a later date (if even then).<\/p><p>Several Clans cultivate this power - the Assamites, Followers of Set, and Malkavians, for example - but the Nosferatu are particularly known for this Discipline. Some elder Kindred believe that Caine, or perhaps Lilith, bestowed the Clan with this Discipline to compensate for the hideous physical deformities its members suffer.<\/p><p>Most Obfuscate powers last for a scene, or until the vampire ceases maintaining them.

In addition, unlike most Disciplines, some of Presence\u2019s powers can be used on entire crowds at one time. Presence can transcend race, religion, gender, class, and (most importantly) supernatural nature. As such, this subtle power is one of the most useful Disciplines a vampire can possess.<\/p><p>Anyone can resist Presence for one scene by spending a Willpower point and succeeding on a Willpower roll (difficulty 8), but the affected individual must keep spending points until he is no longer in the presence of the vampire (or, in the case of Summon, until the effect wears off). Vampires three or more Generations lower than the wielder need only spend a single Willpower to ignore the Presence for an entire night and need not roll Willpower to do so.<\/p><p>The major drawback of Presence is that it controls only the emotions. It causes others to feel a certain way toward the vampire, but does not give her outright control over them.

Ogham is strongest within a Lhiannan\u2019s home territory. More than 50 miles (80 km) from her home territory, the difficulty of using Ogham increases by one across the board, as the Lhiannan\u2019s own spirit-shard comes into conflict with unfamiliar local spirit life.<\/p>"}, {"ID":"27","Name":"Sanguinus","IsSorc":"0","Descr":"<p>Sanguinus is the unwholesome Discipline granted to the Blood Brothers by the Tzimisce who created them. A curious relative of Vicissitude, Sanguinus allows vampires who practice it to combine parts of their bodies, loan them out to others, and coordinate their minds and appendages. Even low levels of it are unsettling to watch. Use of the higher levels is disgusting, indeed, as flesh parts and exposed organs, atrophied by the Blood Brothers\u2019 state of undeath, merge and pulse. Mortals observing the spectacle of this Discipline\u2019s more obvious powers must make Courage rolls (difficulty 4), spend a point of Willpower, or flee the area in nausea.<\/p>"}, {"ID":"28","Name":"Spiritus","IsSorc":"0","Descr":"<p>The Discipline of Spiritus opens the vampire up to worlds and vistas - and methods of feeding - that most Kindred can never touch. Vampires are spiritually dead, unable to create life. The shamanic ritual that created the Ahrimanes, though, allowed a spiritual connection between the undead and the vast, living world all around them. While the vampire can barely scratch the surface of what living shamans can accomplish, the Discipline of Spiritus is still formidable.<\/p>"}, {"ID":"29","Name":"Temporis","IsSorc":"0","Descr":"<p>The True Brujah bloodline claims a peculiar Discipline that allows them some control over the flow of time. Masters of Temporis often grow ever more detached from the passage of ages. This, combined with the natural tendency for Sages to grow emotionally and spiritually distant, makes True Brujah elders exceptionally dangerous. They know that all life is finite, and so they feel no compunction about ending it.<\/p>"}, {"ID":"30","Name":"Thanatosis","IsSorc":"0","Descr":"<p>This Discipline is an exclusive development of the Samedi bloodline, and it is tied intrinsically to the Stiffs\u2019 identity and history. Although Thanatosis appears to deal closely with death and the energies of decay, no Giovanni have ever claimed mastery of this power. Outsiders assume the Giovanni must be interested in learning this Discipline. However, the Giovanni view the Samedi with distrust and loathing, while the Samedi take on the Giovanni is usually expressed by muttering a curse on the Clan and spitting blood. Thus, the possibility of an exchange of information approaches nil.<\/p>"}, {"ID":"31","Name":"Valeren","IsSorc":"0","Descr":"<p>Valeren is a warrior\u2019s Discipline, a holdover from the nights when warrior Salubri acted as noble fighters and Kindred knights. The Discipline is still applicable to the modern nights, but the Salubri <i>antitribu<\/i> put it to decidedly more vicious ends.<\/p><p>Like Obeah, Valeren imparts its practitioners with the fabled third eye of Saulot. The third eye appears at the time the vampire masters the second level of Valeren. The precise nature and purpose of the eye are all but unknown to vampires outside the Salubri <i>antitribu<\/i>. Some suspect the eye grants them sight beyond sight, while others venture that the eye allows them to see the infernal taint in the non-Sabbat Salubri themselves.<\/p>"}, {"ID":"32","Name":"Visceratika","IsSorc":"0","Descr":"<p>Visceratika is an extension of the Gargoyles\u2019 natural affinity for stone and earth. Certain Visceratika powers closely resemble some aspects of Protean and, to a lesser extent, Vicissitude. Tremere in a position to know insist that this is pure coincidence, but the few among the Gargoyles who retain scholarly aspirations insist that the Gangrel and Tzimisce blood used to create the bloodline still maintains a certain hold over its members.<\/p><p>For many years, Visceratika was regarded as endemic to the Gargoyle condition, just like the repulsive visage and the wings with which other Kindred associate the bloodline. That is, vampires - including the Tremere - believed that they couldn\u2019t have the one without the others. Supposedly this isn\u2019t true, and provided one can find a Gargoyle tutor, any vampire can learn the Discipline. Of course, that assumes one can find a willing tutor - the Gargoyles aren\u2019t eager to reveal these secrets. Furthermore, few Kindred want to bet that the Tremere are wrong and risk waking up with wings and horns.<\/p>"}, {"ID":"33","Name":"Countermagic","IsSorc":"0","Descr":"<p>This is less of a path than it is a separate Discipline, as the power to resist Thaumaturgy can be taught independently of Thaumaturgy, even to those Kindred who are incapable of mastering the simplest ritual. Though the techniques of Thaumaturgical Countermagic are not officially taught outside Clan Tremere, unofficial methods are likely to exist. Any non-Tremere who displays the ability to resist Thaumaturgy quickly becomes the subject of potentially fatal scrutiny from the entirety of Clan Tremere.<\/p><p><b>System:<\/b> Thaumaturgical Countermagic is treated as a separate Discipline, although it uses the usual rules for Thaumaturgy (including experience costs and the fact that it is limited to only five levels). It cannot be taken as a character\u2019s primary path, and a rating in it does not allow the character to perform rituals.<\/p><p>The use of Thaumaturgical Countermagic is treated as a free action in combat and does not require a split dice pool. To oppose a Thaumaturgy power or ritual, a character must have a Thaumaturgical Countermagic rating equal to or greater than the rating of that power or ritual. The player spends a blood point and rolls the number of dice indicated by the character\u2019s Thaumaturgical Countermagic rating (difficulty equal to the difficulty of the power in use). Each success cancels one of the opposing thaumaturge\u2019s successes.<\/p><p>Thaumaturgical Countermagic is only at full effectiveness when used against Thaumaturgy. It works with halved dice pools against Necromancy and other mystical Disciplines, and is completely ineffective against non-vampiric magics and powers.<\/p><p>Thaumaturgical Countermagic can be learned by characters who are unable to learn Thaumaturgy (e.g., those with the Merit Magic Resistance). Any non-Tremere character with a rating in this power automatically gains the Flaw Clan Enmity (Tremere), receiving no freebie points for it. This power cannot be taken during character creation and cannot be spontaneously developed. Whether the character has Thaumaturgy as an in-Clan power or not, it costs the same as any other non-Clan Discipline to learn.<\/p>"}, {"ID":"99","Name":"Any","IsSorc":"0","Descr":" "}]
