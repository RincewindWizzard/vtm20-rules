The Daughter can project her voice to any individual she has personally met. Distance is no object, but it must be night wherever the target presently is. The vampire can sing, talk, or otherwise project her voice in any way she sees fit (including other uses of Melpominee), but she cannot hear what she is saying, and therefore suffers a +1 difficulty to any rolls accompanying her utterance. For instance, the vampire could project her voice to an enemy in an attempt to intimidate him, but would suffer a +1 to the difficulty of the ^Charisma + Intimidation^ roll.
_System_: The player rolls ^Wits + Performance^ (difficulty 7) and spends a blood point. Each success allows one turn of speech; three or more successes allow speech for an entire scene.
