Possibly the source of many Malkavians’ conviction that their sire is alive and well on the astral plane, this power allows a Methuselah’s spirit to leave his body while in torpor. While seemingly asleep, the vampire is able to project astrally, think, and perceive events normally.
_System_: No roll is needed. This power is considered to be active whenever the vampire’s body is in torpor, and astral travels are handled as per the rules for Psychic Projection. The vampire is not able to awaken physically at will, however - waking from torpor is handled per the normal rules for such an action (see p.283).
A vampire with this power whose silver cord is severed in astral combat loses all Willpower points, as per the rules for astral combat under Psychic Projection, but is not killed. Instead, he loses the use of this Auspex power and half of his permanent Willpower points. Both the Auspex 9 power and the Willpower must be bought back with experience points. The vampire’s soul slowly returns to his body over the course of a year and a day, during which time he may not be awakened from torpor by any means.
