name: Mirror Reflex
---

This power was developed by a Toreador elder who made a fearsome reputation through her fencing prowess, acting as a hired champion in dozens of Ventrue duels. Mirror Reflex is similar to Prediction in that it is in essence a low-level telepathic scan of an opponent, but this power taps into physical (rather than social) reflexes, allowing the character to anticipate an enemy’s moves in personal combat.
_System_: The player spends a blood point and rolls Perception + the combat skill the opponent is using (difficulty of the subject’s Manipulation + combat skill in use). Each success is an additional die that can be applied to the character’s dice pools during the next turn of combat for any actions taken against the scanned opponent. The use of Mirror Reflex does take one combat action, and the power has a maximum range in yards or meters equal to the character’s Willpower rating.
