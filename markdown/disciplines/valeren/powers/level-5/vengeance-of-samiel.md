name: Vengeance of Samiel
---

The Salubri <i>antitribu</i> strikes his foe with superhuman accuracy and strength, as his third eye opens and changes to a furious, icy blue. Some Furies invoke the names of ancient Salubri warriors, while others simply close their normal eyes and let Samiel guide their hands.
_System_: This power costs three blood points. Any single attack made by the vampire automatically hits the target as mystic forces guide the blow. Attacks made in this manner may not be dodged, though they may be blocked, parried, and soaked as normal. The blow strikes as if the Salubri <i>antitribu</i> had succeeded with all of his Dexterity + Melee or Brawling dice pool (which makes for significant damage). This power may be used only once per turn, and only then the Salubri <i>antitribu</i>â€™s sole action is the attack. Additionally, this power does not work for ranged weapons; only bare hands or melee weapons.
