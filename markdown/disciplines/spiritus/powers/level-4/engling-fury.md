name: Engling Fury

Spirits abound - supposedly everything, from oneâ€™s shirt to the very air, has one. The Ahrimane can take those spirits into herself, break them down, and refresh her own mental reserves. This destroys the spirit, but no repercussions have been reported.
_System_: The player rolls ^Manipulation + Intimidation^ (difficulty 8). Every success allows her to regain a point of Willpower, but each use of this power destroys another spirit.
