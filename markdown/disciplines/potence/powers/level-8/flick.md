It is a truism that “the great ones always make it look easy”. In the case of Flick, that saying stops being a truism and becomes literal truth. With this power, a master of Potence can make the slightest gesture - a wave, a snap of the fingers, the toss of a ball - and have it unleash the full, devastating impact of a dead-on strike. The attack can come without warning, limiting the target’s ability to dodge or anticipate; this makes Flick one of the most feared applications of Potence.
_System_: Flick costs a point of blood, and requires a ^Dexterity + Brawl^ roll (difficulty 6). The vampire must also make some sort of gesture directing the blow. What the gesture is remains up to the player - anything from a snap of the fingers to a blown kiss has worked in the past. Flick’s range is equal to the limit of the Kindred’s perception, and the blow struck does damage equal to a normal punch (including all bonuses).
