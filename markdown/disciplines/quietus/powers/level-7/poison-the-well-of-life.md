name: Poison the Well of Life
---

Beyond leaving emotional traces in a subject’s blood, the master of this Quietus power can now taint that same vitae, making it into a deadly poison for any other Cainite who drinks from that mortal. Some vampires use Poison the Well of Life to guard their own herds against “poachers” or to ward specific vessels against indiscriminate feeding. Others have been known to employ it as a subtle trap for other vampires, turning herds against their owners.
_System_: The character touches the mortal he wishes to taint and smears a streak of his own vitae on the victim’s skin. The player spends three blood points and rolls ^Stamina + Occult^ (difficulty 7). For a number of months equal to the number of successes, any other vampire who drinks that mortal’s blood sustains two health levels of aggravated damage for every blood point imbibed. This damage manifests as a combination of acid burns and something akin to toxic shock. While a mortal is poisonous to vampires, his body’s alchemical balance is slightly altered toward toxicity. He gains two extra points of Stamina for the purposes of resisting the effects and damage of poisons and acids. However, his bodily excretions, especially his sweat, are slightly more noxious than normal. He suffers a one die penalty to all Social dice pools if whomever he chooses to interact with has a particularly sensitive nose and is close enough to smell him.
