name: Far Fatuus
---

This power allows a Kindred to project illusions to any area he can see or visualize. Under most circumstances, accomplishing this requires him to have visited the location in question before he can project illusions there. Although more difficult, a vampire may project illusions on the basis of a description, a photo, or a video clip.
_System_: The difficulty for using Far Fatuus depends on the user’s familiarity with the location. The player must roll ^Perception + Subterfuge^ to affect the location. Once this roll is successful, the vampire may then use any other Chimerstry power on that location.
