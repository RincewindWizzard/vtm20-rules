This Background represents your Generation: the purity of your blood, and your proximity to the First Vampire. A high Generation rating may represent a powerful sire or a decidedly dangerous taste for diablerie. If you donâ€™t take any dots in this Trait, you begin play as a Thirteenth Generation vampire. See p. 270 for further information.
