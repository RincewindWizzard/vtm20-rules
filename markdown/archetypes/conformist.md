The Conformist is a follower, taking another’s lead and finding security in the decisions of others. She prefers not to take charge, instead seeking to throw in with the rest of the group and lend her own unique aid. The Conformist is drawn to the most dynamic personality or the individual she perceives to be the “best”. Being a Conformist is not necessarily a bad thing - every group needs followers to lend stability to their causes. Groupies, party voters, and “the masses” are Conformist Archetypes. Conformist Kindred can take many forms, from the ardent Sabbat pack member, to the Kindred who follows a Clan-first agenda, to the trusted supporters of a titled vampire or rising star.
