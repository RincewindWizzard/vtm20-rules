Name: "Autocrat"
---

The Autocrat wants to be in charge. He seeks prominence for its own sake, not because he has an operationâ€™s best interests at heart or because he has the best ideas (though he may certainly think so). He may genuinely believe others are incompetent, but ultimately he craves power and control. Dictators, gang leaders, bullies, corporate raiders and their ilk are Autocrat Archetypes. A Kindred Autocrat may crave a title, or he may wish to be recognized as the leader of a coterie.
