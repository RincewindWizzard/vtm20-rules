You cannot see. Characters can compensate for the loss of vision by becoming more attuned to other sensory input, but visual cues and images are lost to them. Difficulties of all Dexterity-based rolls are increased by two. Oddly, vampires with Aura Perception (Auspex 2) are still able to use this ability, though the information is interpreted via the other senses. On the other hand, vampires who need to make eye contact to enact powers like Dominate against you are only at a penalty to do so (see the sidebar on p.152).<br>(A target trying to avoid eye contact can make a Willpower roll against a difficulty equal to the Dominate user’s ^Manipulation + Intimidation^ (or other appropriate combination for other Disciplines or specific situations, at the Storyteller’s discretion). The difficulty may be reduced for mitigating factors: -1 in the case of the target obscuring his eyes slightly (such as closing her eyes or wearing dark sunglasses), up to a -3 for the eyes being completely unseen (such as with a thick blindfold or having her eyes torn out). Ultimately, however, it is up to the Storyteller to decide whether eye contact is established in a particular case).
