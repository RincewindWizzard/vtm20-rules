name: Malleable Visage
---

A vampire with this power may alter her own bodily parameters: height, build, voice, facial features, and skin tone, among other things. Such changes are cosmetic and minor in scope - no more than a foot (30cm) of height gained or lost, for example. She must physically mold the alteration, literally shaping her flesh into the desired result.
_System_: The player must spend a blood point for each body part to be changed, then roll ^Intelligence + Medicine^ (difficulty 6). To duplicate another person or voice requires a ^Perception + Medicine^ roll (difficulty 8), and five successes are required for a flawless copy; fewer successes leave minute (or not-so-minute) flaws. Increasing oneâ€™s Appearance Trait has a difficulty of 9, and the vampire must spend an additional blood point for each dot of Appearance increased beyond their natural total. A botch permanently reduces the Attribute by one.
