name: Breath of the Dragon

The vampire becomes like one of the terrible draculs of the Old World, able to exhale a deadly gout of flame. This flame does not hurt the vampire himself, though he may become trapped in flames if it engulfs flammable objects.
_System_: The flaming cloud affects a six-foot area, doing two dice of aggravated damage to anyone in the flamesâ€™ circumference. This fire may cause combustible items to ignite, and it may ignite victims who suffer fire damage as per the fire rules on page 297.
