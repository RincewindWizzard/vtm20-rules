name: Prediction

Some people are capable of finishing their friends’ sentences. Elder vampires with Prediction sometimes begin their friends’ sentences. Prediction is a constant low-level telepathic scan of the minds of everyone the character is in proximity to. While this power does not give the vampire the details of his neighbors’ conscious thoughts, it does provide a wealth of cues as to the subjects’ moods, suppressed refexes, and attitudes toward the topic of conversation.
_System_: Whenever the character is in conversation and either participant in the discussion makes a Social roll, the player may pre-empt the roll to spend a blood point and make a ^Perception + Empathy^ roll (difficulty of the target’s Manipulation + Subterfuge). Each success is an additional die that can be applied to the player’s Social roll or subtracted from the dice pool of the Social roll being made against the character.
