name: Shattering Crescendo
---

The Daughter can sing powerfully enough to rend flesh, split skin, and crack bone. While some Kindred unfortunate enough to witness this power make reference to the fact that even mortal singers can shatter glass at the right frequency, others note that volume and intensity don’t seem to matter when a Daughter employs Shattering Crescendo. The Siren can sing a soothing lullaby and still kill a target.
_System_: Use of this power requires that the victim be within hearing range (characters with hearing difficulties - or Heightened Senses - are affected at the same range as other victims). The player spends one blood point and rolls ^Manipulation + Performance^ (difficulty of the target’s Stamina + Fortitude). Each success inflicts one health level of aggravated damage, which may not be soaked. If using this power on an inanimate object, the Storyteller determines how many dice (if any) the object may use to “soak” and how many successes are needed to completely shatter it.
Multiple Daughters may use this Discipline in concert.
