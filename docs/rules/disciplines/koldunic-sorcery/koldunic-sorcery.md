The actual casting of Koldunic sorcery requires more than a clumsy exertion of will. Such magic demands perfection of form and mastery of the appropriate lore. The caster’s player spends one blood point and rolls (Attribute) + Occult against a difficulty of the power’s level + 3, with the specific Attribute listed for each path or “way.” Vampires always use the base Attribute, ignoring any bonuses gained from blood expenditure or other Disciplines. All kolduns must select one of the ways listed below as their primary path.
