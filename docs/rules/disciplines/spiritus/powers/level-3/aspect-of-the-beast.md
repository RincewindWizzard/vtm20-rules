name: Aspect of the Beast
---

Instead of calling up animal spirits, the vampire learns to emulate aspects of those spirits herself. In this way, she can become faster, stronger, tougher, or gain the special powers of nearly any animals, provided that the spirit is local to the area.
_System_: The player spends a blood point and rolls ^Manipulation + Occult^ (difficulty 7). The power lasts for one turn per success, unless otherwise noted. Some examples of aspects are given below, though the player and Storyteller are welcome to make up others:
_Beaver’s Bite_ - This makes the Ahrimane’s bite strong and sharp enough to cut through almost any substance (though it does no additional damage to living or unliving targets).
_Chameleon’s Colors_ - The Ahrimane becomes capable of changing color to suit the environment (-2 difficulties to all Stealth rolls involving hiding).
_Ears of the Hare_ - The Ahrimane can hear as well as a rabbit, reducing the difficulty of Perception rolls involving hearing by two.
_Falcon’s Eye_ - The Ahrimane can see great distances as if she had the eyes of a falcon (-3 to all Perception rolls involving vision).
_Ferocity of the Cougar_ - All Courage rolls are made at -2 difficulty.
_Leapfrog_ - This grants the Ahrimane the ability to leap three times the normal height and distance. (See p.260 for jumping rules).
_Nose of the Hound_ - The Ahrimane’s sense of smell is far greater than that of a mortal. She can even track by scent on a ^Perception + Survival^ roll (difficulty set by Storyteller).
_Serpent’s Venom_ - The Ahrimane’s bite transmits a venomous toxin that causes two health levels of damage in living victims per turn (see “Poisons and Drugs”, p.301). The damage continues until the toxin is removed or nullified, or until the Ahrimane’s spirit power ends.
_Sound of the Cricket_ - This grants the power to produce an annoying, grating sound loud enough to deafen those nearby. The target suffers a +4 to all Perception rolls related to hearing for the next scene unless he succeeds on a Willpower roll (difficulty 7).
_Squirrel’s Balance_ - The Ahrimane can move about in the branches and limbs of trees or across tightropes with little fear of falling. All such Athletics rolls have their difficulties decreased by two.
_Strength of the Bear_ - This gives the Ahrimane two extra dots of Strength.
_Swiftness of the Stag_ - The Ahrimane can move at twice her normal running speed.
