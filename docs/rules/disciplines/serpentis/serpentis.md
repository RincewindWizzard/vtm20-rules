Serpentis is believed to be the legacy of Set himself, a gift to his children. The Followers of Set are very careful to guard this Disciplineâ€™s secrets, only teaching the art to those who they deem worthy. Most vampires fear the Setites because of the powers of Serpentis and its connection to snakes and reptiles; this Discipline can evoke a primordial fear in others, particularly those who recall the tale of Eden.
