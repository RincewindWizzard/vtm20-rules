Sanguinus is the unwholesome Discipline granted to the Blood Brothers by the Tzimisce who created them. A curious relative of Vicissitude, Sanguinus allows vampires who practice it to combine parts of their bodies, loan them out to others, and coordinate their minds and appendages. Even low levels of it are unsettling to watch. Use of the higher levels is disgusting, indeed, as flesh parts and exposed organs, atrophied by the Blood Brothers’ state of undeath, merge and pulse. Mortals observing the spectacle of this Discipline’s more obvious powers must make Courage rolls (difficulty 4), spend a point of Willpower, or flee the area in nausea.
