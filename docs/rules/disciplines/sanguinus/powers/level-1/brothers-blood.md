name: Brother’s Blood
---

A circle of Blood Brothers is closer than any Sabbat pack, any blood-bound pair of vampiric lovers, any ghoul family. The circle shares flesh, mind, and, of course, blood. The members of the circle can spend blood to heal each other’s bodies, no matter how far apart they are.
_System_: The player spends a blood point, which may be used to heal any member of the circle, regardless of distance from the character. The Blood Brother may also “bank” blood, spending five points to heal another’s aggravated wound over the course of several turns. This power takes effect automatically; no roll is necessary. Blood spent by another Frankenstein does not count against the maximum amount of vitae the target character can spend per turn.
