While most Kindred must employ Dominate through eye contact, some powerful elders may command loyalty with the lightest brush of a hand.
_System_: The character can employ all Dominate powers through touch instead of eye contact (although eye contact still works). Skin contact is necessary - simply touching the targetâ€™s clothing or something she is holding will not suffice. The touch does not have to be maintained for the full time it takes to issue a Dominate command, though repeated attempts to Dominate a single target require the character to touch the subject again.
