Name: "Thrill-Seeker"
---

The Thrill-Seeker lives for the rush of danger. Unlike those of arguably saner disposition, the Thrill-Seeker actively pursues hazardous and possibly deadly situations. The Thrill-Seeker is not consciously suicidal or self-destructive - he simply seeks the stimulation of imminent disaster. Gangbangers, petty thieves and exhibitionists are all examples of the Thrill-Seeker Archetype. Kindred Thrill-Seekers might habitually break the Masquerade just to see if they’ll get caught, they might maintain contacts in a rival Clan or Sect, or they might actively plot a Prince’s overthrow just to see if they can pull it off.
 - Regain a point of Willpower any time you succeed at a dangerous task that you have deliberately undertaken. Thrill-Seekers are not stupid, however, and the Storyteller may choose not to reward a player who heedlessly sends her character into danger for the sole intent of harvesting Willpower.
