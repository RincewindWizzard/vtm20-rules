Name: "Chameleon"
---

Independent and self-reliant, you carefully study the behavior and mannerisms of everyone you come in contact with so you can pass yourself off as someone else later. You spend so much time altering your mannerisms and appearance that your own sire may not even recognize you. Spies, con artists, drag queens, and impostors best represent the Chameleon.
 - Regain a point of Willpower whenever you fool someone into thinking you’re someone else for your own (or your pack or coterie’s) benefit.
